"It is often debated whether employers should involve their employees in the decision-making process. In my opinion, they should. When employees have their say in the management of the company, they will be able to make greater contributions. Employees feel valued when the management listens to their suggestions. This makes them feel loyal to the company and they are less likely to leave. Attrition is one of the main problems that many organizations face today and one of the factors that force employees to leave an organization is that they have no involvement in the management of the company. By keeping employees in the loop about all things relevant to them, the company can enhance their idea of self worth.  In addition, bringing staff members on board for project planning strengthens the relationship between the management and the workers and ultimately increases the productivity of the organization. For example, when sales executives are allowed to participate in the monthly sales target meeting they will get the opportunity to raise their opinions and concerns regarding the sales strategies and recommend new sales markets. This enables them to estimate revenue and risks.  Likewise, when employees are directly involved in decision making they take ownership for their actions. They realize that the success as well as the failure of the organization depends on them. Obviously, this is a great reason for them to give their best to the organization.  In conclusion, involving staff members in the decision-making process is beneficial for all and helps to raise the profit margin of the organization. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"People use diverse modes of transportation in urban areas. Many city dwellers believe that cars are the best way to get around the city. Others, however, argue that the bicycle is a better alternative. In my opinion, despite the fact that bicycles are more environment-friendly, cars are a superior option. On the one hand, many people believe that bicycles are an effective solution to many environmental issues mankind faces. In other words, toxic fumes emitted by automobiles contain greenhouse gases which cause air pollution and global warming. By contrast, cycling does not produce any polluting or hazardous gases and hence it causes no harm to the already fragile environment. To illustrate, in New York City when the local council banned the use of cars and permitted only bicycles, there was a drastic drop in the pollution levels. On the other hand, cars are generally more efficient and convenient than bicycles. They not only help the commuters to reach the workplace on time but also make the journey more comfortable. The yearly output of a large number of businesses will plummet if their employees can’t reach the workplace on time and this will ultimately affect the national economy. Also, bicycles can’t offer the comfort offered by cars. Especially, in the cases of an emergency when the life of a person hinges on timely treatment, a car can prove to be a savior. In such situations cars enable patients to receive / avail of) treatment on time without much discomfort and delay. To sum up, even though bicycles help save / protect the environment, I believe that cars are a superior alternative because of their efficiency and the comfort they provide.",8,False,82.94986449864498,277
"Nowadays, many people are less interested in maintaining any friendly relation with their neighbors. The face to face interaction and the sense of brotherhood have been diminishing since the emergence of the sophisticated life and hi-tech culture. This essay will briefly look into some of its causes and suggest some solutions. Firstly, today’s young generations are well educated and they prefer to migrate to the metros for their livelihood because of this their neighbors are strangers to them. The majority of people do not show the interest to build a sudden relationship with strangers. Apart from this, the cultural and language difference are also a factor of concern when it comes to interaction among the neighbors. Moreover, people are so busy with their work schedule; most of them leave home early in the morning and reach late at the night so they generally do not have enough time to interact with the neighbors. Another reason is the addiction to electronic media. These days, many people spend much of their free time on social networking sites like Facebook and Instagram.  However, this is an unhealthy development and may lead to various social and psychological problems. In order to tackle this, everyone should understand that their neighbors would be more helpful than their closest relatives in case of an emergency situation at their homes. People must reduce the usage of social media which are full of virtual friends and should rather focus on building harmonious relation with their neighbors. People residing in metros should form some clubs to integrate with other people coming from the same state/region as them.  In my own experience I have witnessed that in a funeral service at an apartment in a metro city there were hardly ten to fifteen people. Most of the neighbors in that housing colony were clueless about what happened in that home. To conclude, we should consider the fact that neighbors can be more helpful to us than our nearest relatives in certain situations and we must build good relation with them.

Migration of rural people into urban areas in search of jobs and better standard of living is a common phenomenon in many developing countries. In my opinion, this move has both advantages and disadvantages and it is hard to say whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. On the one hand, when rural youth find good jobs in cities, there will definitely be an improvement in their standard of living. There are not many jobs, especially for the educated, in the countryside; by contrast, they are available in the city and hence this migration is an opportunity for them to escape from the clutches of poverty. In the city, they will also be able to provide better education and healthcare to their children and thus ensure a bright future for their family. On the other hand, when a large number people migrate to cities, they become overcrowded. Most cities are already facing a shortage of liveable space.  This influx of job seekers from the countryside will further degrade the quality of life in metros. For example, in India, almost every villager who cannot find a job in their native place migrates to Mumbai. Consequently, Mumbai is bulging at the seams. Many of these migrants are unskilled labourers who cannot find well-paying jobs. They continue to live in poverty even after moving to the city. Also, because of the unaffordable property prices in cities, millions are living in filthy slums where they struggle are susceptible to developing health problems. The population explosion also worsens air quality and traffic congestion in metropolises. In conclusion, when rural people move to urban areas and find good jobs there, it certainly improves their quality of living. However, most unskilled migrants will end up in low grade jobs and struggle to earn a living. Worse still, this migration makes cities overcrowded and thus deteriorates the overall quality of life. Hence, in my opinion, the advantages of this development more or less equal the disadvantages. ",9,False,78.7407562433788,338
"Children are under tremendous pressure these days. They are required to excel in their studies as well as in extra-curricular activities. They are also required to have a brilliant career once they grow up. Parental pressure is the number one cause of stress on children. Parents want their kids to be super achievers. They do not really care whether their child has the required talent or not. Most children now get hardly any time to play or socialize. They spend much of the day in schools and coaching centres. And afterwards they attend music, drawing and sports lessons. Many of them get barely five or six hours of sleep. Yet, both parents and teachers expect them to stay alert in the class and score excellent grades in their exams. Children are too young to cope with any kind of pressure. Since stress and tension affect their emotional, physical and intellectual development, it is important to shield them from unwanted pressures. Parents need to realize that by expecting too much from their children they are actually setting themselves up for failure and disappointment. Instead they should have realistic goals and ambitions. Time management is equally important. The child should spend their energy on only those things that truly matter. For example, a child who has no real talent for singing should not have to attend music lessons. Likewise, children who are not very sporty should be allowed to skip sports practice. They can use the time thus saved on other activities they are interested in. To conclude, the gap between reality and expectation is the real cause of pressure on children. Since pressure affects the normal growth and development of children, it is important to shield them from unwanted pressure. Both parents and teachers can make life less stressful for children by setting realistic goals for them.",9,False,83.95674801789431,306
"Exponential rise is observed in the number of crimes committed by youngsters, especially in the cities. The desire to make quick money and substance addiction are the main causes of this problem. Providing better education and creating awareness are the most effective solutions.  Many youngsters fall prey to the notion that only money can provide them a quality lifestyle, and to achieve it they get involved in crimes such as pick-pocketing, extortion and even kidnapping. Several others get addicted to drugs and to sustain their addiction they take to the path of crime. As per the recent statistical survey conducted by the Survey Institute of India, crimes such as pick-pocketing and extortion have increased by about forty-seven percentage and involvement of youngsters in such crimes has risen by about twenty-five percentage as compared to last year’s data. In-depth analysis revealed that every third young criminal is addicted to some sort of drugs showcasing the strong correlation between crime, substance addiction and age. The responsibility for correcting these youngsters falls on the shoulders of the Government. Making education available to these young lads at an affordable cost should be of utmost priority. Also, the administration should take initiatives to increase awareness about health hazards and social problems created by substance abuse. For instance, crime rate has decreased by about twenty percent and the number of drug addicts has decreased by about thirty-five percent as per the study conducted by Human Right Association of India in the region of Delhi, after the local governing body launched anti-addiction campaigns and provided free education to them. In addition, the involvement of youngsters has decreased by nearly sixty-five percentage in these crimes. Thus, it is possible to eliminate the causes of youth crime by incorporating appropriate measures. In conclusion, drug abuse and the desire to become rich overnight are the factors that encourage young people to get into crime. Creating employment opportunities and launching anti-addiction programmes will solve this problem to a great extent.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Also subscribe to my Youtube channel for essay organization tips and ideas. According to some people, the academic success of a student is determined by the teaching skills and dedication of their teachers; others insist that a student’s attitude towards learning is the key factor that determines whether he will be successful or not. Both views will be discussed in this essay. On the one hand, it is impossible to write off the contribution of a teacher in the learning process. Teachers impart knowledge. They clear doubts and guide students every step of the way. Talented and dedicated teachers motivate their students to work hard and help them achieve better grades. Teachers are like second parents and they know the strengths and weaknesses of their students and device teaching strategies appropriate for each one of them. On the other hand, a student must have a strong desire to learn and improve if they are to get good grades. No matter how good the teacher is, if the student lacks the desire to learn nothing can help them. That also explains why every class has some students who never get even the passing marks. The same class will also students who scored an A plus grade in each subject. All of them are taught by the same teachers but their scores vary simply because their attitude towards learning is also different. Some students have a strong desire to learn. They will work hard regardless of whether the teacher is good or not. Actually, they will work harder if the teacher is bad. Also, in this day and age when classes are readily available on the internet, no student can blame teachers for their poor grades. In conclusion, the teacher certainly has a role to play in the educational success of the student; however, the role of the teacher is not more important than the attitude of the student towards learning. A student determined to achieve success will achieve it regardless of whether the teacher is good or bad.",9,False,61.5573754789272,337
"These days, in order to reach a large number of people, companies advertise their products extensively. Some people think that these advertisements have negative effects on customers. I wholeheartedly agree with this view because adverts mostly show misleading information to create false demand and hire famous people to attract consumers. In fact, some of them are aimed at children who are too young to understand the consequences of using the advertised products. To begin with, most of the time ads compel people to buy unnecessary products. This is because the mere aim of companies is to attract a large number of consumers and inflate their profits. In order to achieve this goal, they come up with an attractive advertisement showing fabricated information which forces people to buy things they do not even need. Another significant concern about TV commercials is that the companies hire well-known celebrities to endorse their products. This misleads people into believing that their favourite stars also use those products and hence they buy them. Additionally, some of the advertisements especially commercials promoting fast food are aimed at children. These products are mostly made of ingredients that can have adverse effects on the health of children. Take for example, advertisement for chips. When children watch an ad of chips on TV, they force their parents to buy them chips. Eating chips, which is full of salt, oil and monosodium glutamate, can make them lazy and obese. Children, who are usually immature, do not understand the consequences of eating such unhealthy food. Thus it is evident that adverts have damaging effects on children.  To conclude, I totally agree with the view that adverts are harmful because they mislead consumers with false claims and hire celebrities to endorse their products enhance their sales. Worse still, sometimes ads target little ones who have no clue about how dangerous these items could be for them. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is said that art is something that is inseparable from our lives. While some believe that only talented people can create art, I agree with those who feel that everyone has the ability to do so. On the one hand, some people think that creation of art is only possible for people who possess special skills. They argue that only these people can be successful. For instance, human history only recorded the achievements of those artists who were famous in their field, such as Mozart in the music industry. Furthermore, it is sometimes claimed that not every human can survive in such competitive sector. For example, someone may be interested in acting but they cannot become a successful actor unless they are extremely good at acting.  On the other hand, I hold the opinion that creation of art does not require special skills. I think that such talent can be acquired through practice. Playing piano, for example, needs passion and long hours of practice in order to play the music without error. I wholeheartedly believe that all of us can become a professional pianist as long as we are passionate about it. Moreover, I think that everyone has the ability to create art although there is a difference between a good one and a bad one. It is undeniable that some movies are not as popular as some other blockbusters; however, these are still masterpieces regardless of the quality.  In conclusion, even though usually talented people are more likely to survive in the industry, everyone can still be a professional artist as long as they put in enough effort. Therefore, on balance, I believe that creation of art is not limited to any particular individual. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"The amount of criminal activities committed by juveniles across the globe is rising at an alarming rate. This essay will talk about some of the causes of this development and propose some possible resolutions. Research has shown that poor parent child relationships often lead to the child feeling neglected and hurt. As a result, these youths may seek out bad company to find an outlet for their frustration. In addition, if parents are also engaging in vice activities, their offspring might follow suit as they do not have a good role model in their lives.  Secondly, the age of information technology has made all sorts of information readily available with just the click of a mouse. Bad behaviour and habits such as gambling and stealing are glorified in movies and drama series, misleading kids to think that such behaviour is acceptable. Furthermore, young people are heavily protected by the law, making it nearly impossible for them to get punishment should they commit a crime.   On the bright side, they are several ways to improve the situation. Parents and teachers should work together to provide youth an open, nurturing environment. Parents are responsible for instructing and bringing up their children in the right way. Teachers should impart knowledge and mould their character by helping them distinguish right from wrong. Governments should implement stricter media censorship to make adult content not as easily accessible. Lastly, if a teenager has committed a crime, harsher sentences should be meted out so that their peers will get the message that heinous acts will not be tolerated in this society. To conclude, lousy parenting, easy access to media and light punishments are some of the reasons for the increase in the youth crime rate. Governments, parents and teachers and the law all have an equal part to play in convicting, counselling and guiding these young lives in order to ensure a safe and brighter future for the younger generation.

"In some nations, vegetarianism is gaining popularity and I think it is a positive development. A vegetarian diet may be deficient in certain nutrients; however, in my opinion, the advantages of vegetarianism far outweigh the disadvantages.   Vegetarians are less likely to develop certain life threatening diseases like obesity, cancer or heart trouble because plant based foods are low in fat and rich in fibre which safeguard our body from various lifestyle diseases. For example, a report by WHO organisation reveals that people who eat animal based diet such as red meat are more likely to suffer from cardiovascular ailments because of the high fat content present in the meat. Therefore, I believe that consuming a plant based diet is a better way to live a healthy life. Another advantage of vegetarianism is that it allows us to sustain ourselves without harming other forms of life. On the flip side, people who consume only plant based foods can face the deficiency of certain vitamins, minerals and proteins and this might lead to malnutrition. For example, animal sources such as meat, fish and eggs are rich in proteins and aid the development of body. While protein is also present in vegetarian foods, the quantity is low. According to a survey protein deficiency is uncommon among people who follow a non-vegetarian diet whereas these deficiencies are common among Indians because most of them are vegetarians. However, the inadequacy of these vital nutrients and minerals can be addressed by taking supplements of these in the form of tablets. In conclusion, while it is true that a vegetarian diet is deficient in certain nutrients, it provides ample protection from many deadly diseases. Also, the nutritional deficiencies can be solved by taking supplements; hence, in my opinion, the advantages of following a vegetarian diet far outweigh the disadvantages.

"Children become more mature as they age. Brains of children, especially of those under the age of 10, are very impressionable and it is important to teach them the difference between good and bad. Although there is a popular notion that kids should be treated with strict punishment to make them learn good virtues, I disagree with this opinion. In this essay I will be providing arguments to support my claim. Firstly, mistakes made by kids are often a by-product of their natural inquisitiveness. Punishing them for being curious could affect their self esteem / confidence. History is replete with examples of people who were initially termed as law breakers because they defied conventional norms, but later were hailed as stalwarts of their respective fields. A famous example of this is Copernicus who was punished for his solar planetary system theory. Later, the same theory was accepted as being correct. Thus, punishing children for minor mistakes can dissuade them from taking risks in their adult life. On the other hand, it is important to admonish kids for certain acts that are detrimental for the society. If kept unchecked, this behaviour can cause the kids to be a part of anti-social elements. In such cases, guardians should instil good behaviour in their wards by making them understand the consequences of their acts. One possible way to do this is to deny them luxuries, such as chocolates or video games, as a repercussion of their bad actions. Hence, children should be punished if they commit any heinous acts.  To conclude, punishment as a way to help children learn good and bad things is not the only way to make kids well-mannered. Punishment, for minor offenses, can cause the kids to be risk averse in later part of their life. Hence, it would be better if kids are made aware of the consequences their actions could have.

"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.",8,False,90.3960979687194,338
"According to some people, learning a new language at a young age is beneficial for children because it enables them to enhance their communication skills and career prospects. I fully agree with this view. In my opinion, children should be encouraged to learn foreign languages at primary school itself because at this age they can learn faster and acquire proficiency with little effort.  Bilingualism and multilingualism are coveted skills that people can acquire in this globalized world and children have a greater ability to learn new languages than adults. For example, a 3 year old can learn multiple languages by simply interacting with people who speak those languages. By contrast, an adult in a similar situation has to put in considerable effort to gain even working knowledge of foreign languages. This is because children are better equipped to learn new languages and to take advantage of this natural ability they should be taught a second or third language at an early age.  Foreign language skills will only benefit the child and has no adverse impacts on them. A child who is a polyglot can survive in any foreign country. Needless to say, when he grows up he can easily get prestigious jobs in the multinational companies as he is able to interact with his colleagues using multiple languages.  In conclusion, foreign language skills are crucial in this age of globalisation and young children should be motivated to become bilingual or multilingual at an early age because they have better language learning skills than adults.

"Some people hold the opinion that it is such a waste of free time to watch sport. I disagree with this view. In my opinion, watching sports can enhance bonding within communities and promote a healthier lifestyle among individuals.  Watching sport on television or from the gallery is an opportunity for people to come together and cheer for their team. Fans watching the game together may have different status in life and they may endorse different religious beliefs or political ideologies. However, when they watch the game, they have only one concern in the world and that is to see their team emerge victorious. Obviously, sporting events bring people closer and help them forget their differences. When their team wins an international match, it is celebration time for all of them. Sports even ignite patriotic feelings in people. Community bonding is not the only benefit of watching sports. When people watch their favourite sportspersons in action, they feel encouraged to stay fit and live a healthier life. Teenagers, in particular, adore sporting heroes and want to emulate their lifestyle. Needless to say, people who watch sports matches regularly tend to live physically active lives. They are also healthier. For example, a recent study showed that there was a 30% increase in gym memberships during the recently held World Cup Football championship. By contrast, watching other television shows or engaging in other activities during free time does not produce this effect. This is because the content is less inspiring and it does not motivate people to change their lifestyle. Thus, it is evident that watching sports in free time motivates people to engage in physical activity and live healthier lives.  To conclude, watching sports is not a waste of time. It promotes stronger bonding within communities and leaves a positive impact on people by encouraging them to pursue a healthy way of life.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"World population increased rapidly in the last few decades. Urban areas are the worst affected due to population growth. Over population increases the cost of living and worsens pollution. However, these issues can be tackled to a great extent if authorities and people make a concerted effort.  With the advent of the technology, governments are rapidly developing urban areas. Therefore, more people are migrating to big cities and this has led to many problems. Firstly, overpopulation has led to an increase in the cost of living in urban areas. As the number of people increases, demand for accommodation also increases. To solve this problem, governments should develop rural areas by building some infrastructure and creating jobs. When jobs are available in the countryside people stop migrating to big cities, and burden on urban areas would reduce to some extent. Thus, with proper planning, problems caused by overpopulation in urban areas can be solved. Another major effect of overpopulation is air pollution. As the number of people increases, more people start using transport services like cars and motorcycles, thereby leading to increase in air pollution. Some studies have shown a direct correlation between population increase and air pollution. Therefore, governments should pass some strict laws on birth control to reduce population increase.  For example, countries can adopt the one child policy started by China to restrict population growth. Although this may not solve the problem completely, it will definitely reduce the population to some extent. To recapitulate, while there are some advantages to having more people, we can see that overpopulation has some serious impacts not only on governments but also on nature. With proper planning and by adopting some policies, governments can tackle these problems easily. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"     In some countries, private schools are inevitable for imparting fundamental education to children because of population explosion and some other problems. While some people opine that governments should fund private schools, others believe that founder(s) of private schools should pay all expenses incurred. In my opinion, state funding will encourage private schools to impart education of better quality and it is necessary in some cases.      To begin with, there are various reasons for governments to fund private schools. The first and foremost reason is that some private schools set and exemplary standard of teaching and excel at honing student’s latent skills. Secondly, there are many people who want to make a difference to the society by teaching the underprivileged. However, not all of them are wealthy enough to start or a run a private school. Government funding will help them start out and make a contribution to the society. The government should also assist individuals or organizations who want to start schools in remote areas. Often times, these areas do not have enough government schools. If private entities can start schools with state funding in such areas, it will boost the development of the local community.       On the other hand, state funding to ultramodern private schools is unnecessary. First of all, most of these schools operating in metropolitan areas collect an exorbitant amount of fee from their students. Also, they only cater to affluent students who can afford their fee. The government does not have to fund them.       To conclude, government funding is strongly recommended for schools which provide fundamental education to children who are socially and economically backward.",9,False,72.00589330024815,269
"Owing to recent technological advancements, people can access entertainment programmes on their mobile devices at any time convenient to them. In my opinion, the detrimental effects these inventions can have on our behavior and family life outweigh any benefits they might bring. Admittedly, the only benefit of using portable mobile phones and computers for watching our favorite content is that they are cost effective. With a one-time investment in these devices, we can eliminate the additional costs of buying movie tickets and video games each time we want to access them for higher prices, provided we have strong internet connection. For instance, the popularity of applications such as Netflix and Amazon Prime are at their peak, as they help in downloading programs, watching latest movies and playing games. Nevertheless, despite the above advantage, I believe that there are some extremely serious issues associated with the usage of these devices/ equipments for entertainment. One such potentially dangerous problem is that it ruins morality. In other words, such devices jeopardize the character of individuals, especially of children, by provoking them to watch inappropriate movies and videos, which ultimately lead children to indulge in anti-social activities, including cybercrimes.  Another negative impact is that these gadgets conspicuously ruin family relationships. When there are more platforms for watching our favorite channels, we tend to spend less time with family members and this gradually paves the way for conflicts, dissatisfaction and disappointments among the members. That is why the number of teenagers attempting suicide and leaving home is rising. They lack emotional bonding with their parents and also lack the emotional maturity to deal with setbacks. In conclusion, I strongly reckon that any development which would disturb the stability of our mind and relationships should not be encouraged, even if they provide some financial benefits.

"Research is considered as a pivotal part of academics especially in professional courses, which ultimately led to many inventions in various fields, the world over. However, in this contemporary era, a major problem that many academic institutions all over the world face is plagiarism. This essay delves into various causes of plagiarism and suggests some solutions to curb the menace. To begin with, the internet has been considered as the greatest invention of the last century, which in-turn aid the mankind in every possible way. However, students these days are becoming lazy and, also they are reluctant to check the facts that are available on the internet. As a result, a perilous copy-paste culture is developing among youths. Owing to this, students try to copy their assignments, thesis and so on from the internet and they seldom check for plagiarism. The existence of paid publications is another factor contributing to plagiarism. For example, in the majority of the professional courses, it is compulsory for students to publish their research work in journals. Students submit their work to these publications which do not check the authenticity of the paper and get it published by paying a fee. The lack of commitment on the part of project leaders who are supposed to guide the students is another reason for academic plagiarism. We can find a great gap between the recommended research methodology and the actual method that students follow these days.  To overcome these problems, firstly, proper guidance should be given to students about the wise use of the internet for research activities and, also they should be motivated to refer reliable text books from libraries instead of simply copying the content from the internet. Secondly, identifying and banning mercenary journals would be a great idea to overcome the issue of plagiarism. For instance, there are several free and reputed journals like IEEE, Elsevier and Nature which possess high levels of credibility and students should be motivated to publish their papers in them. Moreover, faculties should review their students’ thesis thoroughly to avoid the copyright infringement. To conclude, there is no doubt that piracy in academics is becoming a main problem in many nations around the world. The reasons include internet misuse, lack of guidance and ease of getting articles published in paid publications. However, this issue could be reduced to a great extent if we followed the solutions as suggested above. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The use of surveillance equipments such as body scanners and CCTV are becoming increasingly popular. However, some opine that those equipments would hinder their privacy. Although the installation of those equipments might affect people’s privacy, it would strengthen the safety measures significantly. In my opinion, the benefits of installing these equipments far outweigh the drawbacks. At the outset, due to the increase in the crime rate the safety devices were introduced to deter such crimes. Criminals are using advanced technology to commit an offence, which makes it extremely difficult for the police to crack their modus operandi using the traditional ways. In order to counter these crimes, surveillance cameras are installed in public places and they are beneficial to a great extent. For example, Mumbai police reported that the crime rates dropped drastically in the last decade due to installation of advanced equipments in the city. The main advantage of the installation of these equipments would be the safety and security of the citizens. On the other hand, despite the increase in the safety of the people, the widespread use of these safety instruments has affected one’s privacy and caused some inconvenience especially to celebrities. Many hackers tend to hack the system and leak the CCTV footage, because of which reputation of many known people have got tampered. Such misuse of the CCTV footages has potentially affected people’s privacy. Body scanners could also be potentially used to humiliate or harass people. Thus the argument that such devices infringe on the privacy of people certainly hold some people. However, in my opinion, safety is more important than privacy. Also, these devices are usually only used in public places and by simply being careful of our conduct in such places we can save us from being photographed in embarrassing positions. To conclude, the installation of surveillance devices like CCTV cameras certainly pose some threat to people’s privacy; even so, in my opinion, they are more beneficial than harmful because they help reduce crime and enhance our safety.

"Some people prefer to use a car to get about while others opt for the bicycle. In my opinion, both modes of transport have their merits and demerits. However, I prefer the bicycle for traveling short distances.  The biggest advantage of bicycles is that they are an eco-friendly mode of transport. They do not emit any greenhouse gases or pollute the air. Bicycles are also a cheap mode of transport because they do not require any fuel. Another advantage of riding a bicycle is that it is healthy. It helps burn excess calories and prevents health problems like obesity and heart trouble. However, bicycles do have some downsides. To start with, bicycle riding is a physically demanding task and as such it is not suitable for traveling long distances. Another disadvantage is that bicycles do not provide any protection from rain or shine. Cars, by contrast, are the ultimate in comfort. They allow people to travel in an air-conditioned environment and provide adequate protection from inclement weather. In addition, cars are fast and perfect for covering long distances in a short period of time. However, they have some serious disadvantages. For one thing, traveling by car is expensive. For another, cars pollute the air. Actually, studies have shown that automobiles are the number one cause of air pollution. They also cause road congestion.  To sum up, both cars and bicycles have their pluses and minuses. Personally, I would prefer a bicycle if the journey is short and the weather is good.  For traveling long distances, I will always take a car.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Since human beings can derive nutrition from plant based sources and synthetic materials can be used instead of leather, some people opine that it is no longer necessary to kill animals. I do not agree with this view because not all nutrients can be obtained from plants. In my opinion, in order to preserve traditions and to fulfill human need for nutrients, animal slaughter should be permitted in a less brutal way.  Dwellers in certain geographic locations have been adapted to eating some foods. Such eating habits may are adapted to eating animal foods. Such eating habits may have existed for hundreds of years and become a part of the local lifestyle. The Japanese, for instance, live by the sea and take food source. It is not exaggerating to say that forbidding seafood will have a major impact on their life. In addition, nutrient elements from meat are essential. For example, beef and mutton provide us with numerous protein and vitamins, which are of great importance in building bones, muscles, cartilage and skin. Thus, it is fair to say animal-based products are an indispensable part in our live and thus cannot be replaced. Nevertheless, we should not ignore the fact that slaughtering causes considerable pain to animals. According to Human International Society, animals used in the fur industry are commonly subjected to force feeding and food and water deprivation. Where fox fur coats are considered as a symbol of social status, skins are stripped off when foxes are still alive. In order to keep these animals’ suffering to a minimum, such barbaric practices should be put to an end. In other words, humane methods should be adopted, such as stunning them by electrocution prior to killing. Meanwhile, strict punishments ought to be imposed on cruel slaughter. That is to say, we have the obligation to ensure animal welfare and prevent animals from being treated inhumanly.  In summary, due to the significance of animal foods to our culture and health, we should not ban the slaughtering of animals. However, we are supposed to eliminate agonizing slaughter and minimize their suffering. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Controlling the burgeoning human population is the need of the hour. The global population is expected to cross 11.2 billion by the end of the 21st century and but according to statistics the earth cannot sustain more than 10 billion people. That means there is an urgent need to control the population growth. Some governments have already set a limit to the number of children a family can have and those who violate this rule are required to pay tax on the extra children. In my opinion, this is a viable measure that governments all over the world can implement.  To start with, imposing a tax on children who exceed the permitted number will send the right message to people. It will force lower and middle class families to limit the number of children they have. Affluent parents will also be influenced by this move because they will not want to expend their money in taxes for more children. The government can use the money thus collected for public welfare schemes.  Levying a tax on every second or third child will also indirectly make people realize the burden of population on the society. Parents will realize that every additional child destabilizes their financial security and hurts the economy of the nation. What’s more, this way of controlling the population sounds less harsh. Measures such as population awareness campaigns, celebrity endorsement and education programmes in schools are rather soft and ineffective. On the other hand, stringent steps such as forcible sterilization and a strict one child policy may outrage the citizens. In summary, I believe that imposing taxes on children who exceed the permitted limit is an effective and rightful measure to control the population growth. It will convey the message that a family can have additional children only at their own expense.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"The depletion of consumable natural resources at an accelerated speed is a matter of grave concern since it has given birth to several problems in the world. Nevertheless, these issues can be resolved by taking some effective remedial steps. The reduction in the green cover has had a negative effect on earth’s weather conditions. To elaborate, forests help to maintain the temperature of earth. The cutting down of trees at a fast pace for fulfilling human’s greed has created a climatic imbalance and the earth’s average temperature has risen by 2 degree Celsius in the last ten years. One of the biggest consequences of global warming is that our summers are getting hotter and hotter. Furthermore, because of the depletion of fresh water resources, people are now forced to buy drinking water. The poor and the weaker sections of the society are the worst hit by the water crisis. Consequently, many people are dying due to lack of drinking water in African states and several others are left with only contaminated water for their daily use. Depleting oil resources also have had a negative impact on the automobile industry which relies almost wholly on oil for its operation. However, some viable solutions do exist and it is possible to solve the aforementioned problems to a great extent. First, cutting down of trees should be checked, and industries which use wood for manufacturing their products, such as furniture and houses, should be encouraged to find eco-friendly alternatives. Second, the government and the media should launch campaigns that make people aware of the importance of saving water. It is also important to set a limit on the amount of water that can be used for domestic and industrial purposes. Third, scientists should be encouraged to find renewable fuels for vehicles. For instance, chargeable electric cars are gaining popularity in the US because they are eco-friendly and economical. In conclusion, although the fast paced consumption of natural resources has directly influenced the climate of earth, the collaborative efforts of governments, scientists and the public can reduce the impact.",8,False,75.72317579878239,344
"Artists generally earn less all over the world; therefore it is believed that the government should help them financially so that they can continue their work. I completely agree with this sentiment as artists represent a country on the international stage so they have to be encouraged and also they play an important role in shaping the culture and history of a nation.  Art knows no boundaries and any good piece of art is appreciated around the world and this helps a nation to get recognition in the international circuit. In order to encourage this, the state has to fund the under paid artists so that they can represent their country in various fields. For instance, the greatest Bismillah Khan who used to play a musical instrument called Shehnai was from a very humble background. He was very talented and one of the best in his field. The government recognized this and supported him in every way. He went on to become the best musician in his domain globally and received many international awards. Thus we can see how funding an artist can make a country proud on the international platform.  Furthermore, artists play a significant role in taking the traditional culture forward through music, food, movies and many other artistic activities. As a result, in order to give a boost to the cultural activities the government should fund all the deserving artists. For example, handicraft industry is a very old form of art work in India. It is not a very highly paid job but directly connected to the traditions and customs of India. To support these handicraft workers the state has implemented many schemes through which they can obtain the benefits and gain reasonable amount of profit from their work. This step by the government has kept the traditional handicraft industry alive. Thus, clearly it is very vital for the administration to support the artists so that the old form of art and tradition is preserved and maintained.   In conclusion, I firmly believe that the government has to support artists and fund them so that they can flourish in their fields and thus preserve the traditional culture and bring international recognition to a nation in different spheres.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Humans have become a prime culprit for the destruction of the wildlife population around the world. Humans believe that they are the most powerful species on this planet and have therefore chosen to use all of nature’s resources for their own good, even if this results in the destruction of the environment around them. Clearly, this is not a positive result of human existence and many people believe that the world’s wildlife population should be better protected.One possible way to protect wildlife around the world is to reduce the amount of polluted substances produced through the human way of life. It has become habitual for people to pollute water by adding chemicals to it during industrial processes or to pollute air as a result of the fossil fuel industries and car emissions. Stopping the addition of chemicals to water and creating cleaner processes would reduce water pollution and help create a safer environment for wildlife to live in. Increasing the availability and use of public transportation and increasing the use of renewable energy sources could reduce world pollution further.Another possible attempt to protect wildlife around the world is to actively promote recycling projects to reduce the amount of resources that are wasted. This would lessen the degradation of the natural environment, as humans continue to search for new resources. Society uses a lot of paper and wood on a daily basis and people do not actively think about whether or not they are wasting these resources. Printing double-sided or on recycled paper for example would appear to change nothing, yet if carried out regularly would help make a difference.In conclusion, there are numerous different ways in which every human being can help to protect the wildlife population around the world. One can engage in projects to raise awareness of environmental destruction or one can actively take part in activities to protect it. Everyone must find the area in which he or she would like to involve him or herself, as all should be obliged to protect wildlife around the world.",9,False,64.19402985074626,340
"It is true that there has been a rise in the number of married couples who do not want to bring a child into this world. This is particularly true in the western world. The main advantage of this trend is that it allows a couple to live a carefree life with fewer responsibilities and the main drawback is they will feel lonely when they get old. Having no children after marriage means fewer responsibilities for a couple. They can enjoy their life free from any extra financial stresses because they do not need to handle the expenditures of raising a child. Therefore, they do not need to work for extra hours to earn more money and they can spend their life fulfilling their dreams and accomplishing their aspirations. For example, a study by The Times shows that 52% of married couples having with no children tend to live a more enjoyable and happier life than those who have children since they remain anxious about their children’s future. On the other hand, the main disadvantage of this phenomenon is that when the couple gets old and infirm they might miss the mental and emotional support which is extremely important for the elderly people. This will make them feel isolated and depressed and they might end up feeling miserable in the twilight years of their life. This situation could worsen if either the husband or the wife dies untimely. In conclusion, although the decision to have no children after marriage is beneficial for people who do not want to be burdened with the responsibilities associated with parenthood, childless couples are more likely to experience loneliness and the lack of a good support system as they age.

"According to some people, charities should help only those people who live within their national boundaries; however, others opine that help should be provided everywhere. In my opinion, it depends on the mission of the organization and its resources. Both views will be discussed in this essay before arriving at a conclusion.  On the one hand, some people put forth the statement that it is reasonable for non-governmental organizations to only serve people of their own country because the resources originated from their own people. This also matches the expectations of the donors who are aware of the goals of the local organizations. Furthermore, some underdeveloped countries are so deprived that they have great difficulties to support the basic living and daily necessities of local people. In this case, charity funds should prioritize local citizens instead of people from other nations.  On the other hand, some people insist that helping behaviors are rooted in moral and humanistic standard and people should provide assistance without borders. Since these organizations are internationally based, they can reach thousands and millions of people globally and heighten people’s awareness of their missions and purposes. For instance, UNICEF is an international organization which aims to aid children worldwide. The organizations also obtain funding and resources from affluent countries such as America and Sweden and they have huge financial backup. It is understandable that when we have more power, we are obliged to help the poorer. After all, we all belong to the same family called humanity.  To conclude, driven by empathy and ethics, charity organizations aim to help and support people who are in need. However, who they should help depends on the purpose of the organizations and how much funding they receive.",8,False,75.33485966595447,287
"It is often said that taking precautionary measures in dealing with diseases is a better approach than getting treatment after contracting one. Although this adage may be true, not all diseases can be prevented and therefore require treatment in order to be cured. This essay disagrees with this statement and will discuss why sometimes diseases cannot be prevented and hence research is necessary to cure them. There are a number of diseases that cannot be prevented through precaution such as, measles, polio, chicken pox etc. Moreover, there are diseases which are genetically linked and people who have defective genes will contract these illnesses at some point of time. Therefore, in such cases one has to visit a hospital and get necessary treatment in order to get cured. For instance, Type 1 diabetes, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease and certain types of cancers are hereditary and they can only be treated through medication and therapy. Without research, treatment for non preventable diseases will not be possible. In addition to that, there will always be new disease outbreaks due to the evolution of bacteria and viruses. Recently, many people suffered from Ebola fever that led to the death of patients in severe cases. The causative virus also affects the development of fetus in pregnant women. Therefore, we need to actively conduct research and arm ourselves to tackle unknown as well as non preventable diseases. To conclude, prevention should be practiced as a precaution to avoid getting sick, but this will not help us avoid certain illnesses which require medical intervention. Hence, research is absolutely required to develop vaccines, medicines and medical procedures to deal with genetically linked diseases and non preventable diseases. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Attending college is considered to be one of the most crucial decisions of a person’s life. There are several reasons why people decide to embark on university life / college life. College enables people to develop their intellect, gain new experiences and earn respect in the society.  Most people believe that in order to be successful they need to earn a degree first. In the past, a college education was not a crucial necessity to get a job. If you worked hard enough and had connections, you could find a job with little difficulty. Nowadays, the world has become more competitive and demanding. People need not only work experience, but also a good education to be able to find a decent job. Young people understand this and are willing to prepare themselves as well as they can to ensure their place in the workforce.  Another reason why people decide to go to college is that they want to enhance their perspectives. By having new experiences, young people can better comprehend how the world works. Usually, students need to face different types of situations at college such as working in teams, making presentations, speaking in public, and many more. All these assignments are designed to get you out of your comfort zone and make you experience an unfamiliar situation. Therefore, the best place to prepare yourself for the real world is college. Parental pressure is another factor that encourages students to go to college. The fear of disappointing them forces many youngsters to join college. Young people want to live up to their parents’ expectations, and they will go to any extent to make them happy.  In conclusion, there are many factors that may influence a person’s decision to attend college, but the most important one is the fear of not being successful.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to some people, regular workouts are the secret of good health; others, however, insist that following a nutritious diet is even more important. In my opinion, people who want to live a healthy and long life should nutritious foods and follow an exercise regimen. Getting physically active is crucial for staying healthy and young because regular exercise benefits the human body in many ways. For example, it increases the blood circulation, boosts metabolism and provides immunity to various types of diseases. Studies have shown that people who work out regularly have considerably low risk of developing heart trouble or diabetes. Actually, engaging in regular physical activity is crucial for controlling many medical conditions like diabetes. Nowadays, we all live rather sedentary lives and it is impossible to get the exercise we need by simply going about life. For this reason, it is important for us to set aside at least 30 minutes a day for our workout.  However, exercise alone will not help because for optimal functioning, our body needs a variety of micro and macro nutrients that only a balanced diet can provide. Nutritional deficiency can lead to a host of ailments such as anaemia, goitre and brittle bones. A balanced diet provides all the nutrients our body needs and helps keep us in good health. In fact, those who follow a good diet show increased immunity against various illnesses.   In conclusion, a balanced diet coupled with a good exercise regime is the secret to good health. In my opinion, both are crucial for good health and it is impossible to say whether one is more important than the other. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"University education system is one of the most widely discussed topics these days. Many people believe that college students should be allowed to choose subjects they like to study. Others think that it is always better to learn subjects that have relevance in the future and I agree with them. Both views will be discussed in this essay. On the one hand, there are people who claim that college students should be given the privilege of choosing the subjects of study. Usually, the subjects for a particular course are decided by the university. According to these people, doing these courses is not effective and this has to change. If students get the opportunity to choose their subjects, learning will become more interesting for them. In addition, there are students who have talents in many other fields. Therefore, this proposed change in the education system will allow them to enhance their knowledge in a wide variety of subjects and polish their talents. For instance, if we include some arts and cultural subjects in engineering courses, this would pave the way for them to explore other fields. Nevertheless, this will affect the focus and ruin the quality of education. On the other hand, some people believe that education should be based on the major subjects of the particular course rather than student’s interest. In their view, when students complete their course, they should have a thorough knowledge of that area. This is only possible if they study the subjects specific to the stream. Moreover, when we consider the future, competition for jobs will be very high and industries will hire only the finest talents. For example, a lot of innovations are happening. New subject topics and research fields have started to come up resulting in the betterment of technologies. Since the employment opportunities will be based on this technological knowledge, it is therefore, highly important that university students should focus more on studying these subjects for their better future. To conclude, many people are against studying only core subjects; however, it is always better to study these subjects and make their fundamentals strong for a successful future.",8,False,63.10955940204563,355
"Many individuals consider climatic changes detrimental for their business; however, others consider it as an opportunity to grow. In my opinion, climatic change creates new business opportunities. Both the viewpoints are discussed in the essay. Climate change can certainly hurt businesses. For example, extreme weather conditions affect crops. A poor harvest will make farmers poorer and affect rural economies. When farmers do not have money to spend, the demand for products will decrease. Obviously, this is detrimental for all business. Likewise, extreme rainfall or flooding may force stores to stay closed for days on end. All of these scenarios are harmful for businesses.  Conversely, for many companies the changing weather conditions are an affirmative way to grow. This is because climatic changes create new demands and as the demands are dynamic, the organisations can grab the opportunity to provide whatever is needed. For example, in 2019, Delhi was covered with smog in the month of October and according to the survey conducted by the Economic Times, the sale of air-purifiers and anti-pollution masks increased by almost 100%. Likewise, poor rainfall increases the demand for rainwater harvesting systems. In the same way, hotter summers provide manufactures a great opportunity to sell more fans and air conditioners. These examples clearly prove that if businesses are capable of catering to the changing needs of the society in the wake of climate change, they can reap rich dividends.  In conclusion, although many people consider climate change as bad for their business, in my opinion it is possible to gain huge monetary benefits from such changes.

"According to some people, every activity that children pursue in their leisure time should have some educational value. They believe that activities that do not teach anything are useless. I fully agree with this view.  When educational elements are made a part of leisure time activities, children learn effortlessly and with pleasure. In Sweden, for example, the government has passed a law that makes it mandatory for toymakers to incorporate some educational value into every toy they sell. This makes learning a fun activity for children.  In addition, leisure time activities that are educational in nature make the best use of children’s time. This approach also ensures that they do not waste their time doing activities that are harmful or useless. For example, lots of children all over the world play the Pokemon cards and waste countless hours gathering information about some fictitious characters. This is a complete waste of time. If these cards were replaced by some informative cards or if the characters were from history or mythology, the children would still have fun and at the same they would also acquire valuable knowledge. Thus it is evident that by simply making some changes to the toys and games in the market, we can help our children learn with fun and pleasure. Another advantage of educational leisure activities is that most of them require the active participation of parents. Thus they play an important role in strengthening the parent-child relationship.  To conclude, after analysing the situation, it is not hard to see that there are numerous benefits to adding some educational elements to free time activities. However, parents must ensure that the emphasis is on leisure and that learning does not become burdensome for the children.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Discus both these views and give your own opinion. Give reason for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience. Write at least 250 words. The renaissance that took place in Europe after the “dark ages” brought with it the call for a “free” society, where people have equal opportunities despite their race, skin colour or gender. With regards to gender equality in education, a rift was created between the liberal ideology, created after the renaissance, and the traditional ideology. While the liberals believe that females should be treated exactly like their male counterparts, hence attend the same schools, the traditionals believe that segregating boy from girls avoid unnatural behaviour and protects their chastity and modesty. In my opinion, both extremes are unhealthy for our society: unconditional mixing breaches the personal space of both genders, while absolute restriction creates a contrived society. The argument for mixed-gender schools is based on the natural constituents of the human race, which include both men and women, and on the interdependence between males and females. The fact that both genders exist and are imperative for the sustenance of the society calls for equal treatment for both sexes. It is then argued that every body should be treated according to their humanity rather than gender. Also, men and women are both needed for a balanced society. In fact, interaction between both genders is inevitable. Therefore, restricting such interactions at schools creates a socially awkward community. Furthermore, such restriction causes more indecent behaviours between boys and girls, who are trying to fill the gap that segregation may create. However, some people are of the opinion that segregation protects the manners of our society. First, it is natural that, in mixed schools, males and females will try to flatter each other due to the natural inclination towards each other. This creates a more unnatural and psychologically ill behaviour. This is demonstrated in movies that describe the high school culture today, such as “High School Musical”. Furthermore, they believe that segregation protects the girl’s chastity and modesty, as they are not always exposed to men. This also avoids deceptive emotional attachment before maturity. For example, research shows that most boys in school associate their relationship with girls to sexual reasons. In my opinion, both extremes are dangerous. Therefore, there should be selective segregation, where girls and boys undergo most of their education together, but are segregated in certain situations to guard their personal space and physicality. For example, swimming classes should not be done in a mixed-gender environment to avoid explicit body exposure to opposite genders. Also, sports like running should be done separately due to the differing physical capabilities of males and females. In short, while mixed gender schooling system is a disputed issue, I believe that it is best for segregation to be done in a case-by-case manner, while maintaining the natural human interaction between males and females.",7,False,78.17694932826473,486
"An increasing number of people are getting diagnosed with obesity and associated health problems. While some argue that rise in the price of fast foods will alleviate this situation, I partially disagree with this view.  It is true that convenience foods play a vital role in weight gain. Due to the fact that they are high in salt, fat and calories, fast foods are considered unhealthy. Their cheap prices, however, are attractive and act as an added incentive for customers. Poor or middle class people are more likely to purchase junk foods since it is both enjoyable and affordable to eat. Increasing the price of fast food will certainly make it unaffordable to the lower strata of the society. Unfortunately, this will further limit the options available to them because healthy food is already unaffordable to them.  On the other hand, price hike cannot tackle the underlying issue. Healthy eating habits and regular exercise are the major solutions. Since people develop eating preferences at an early age, it is difficult / taxing for them to adopt alternatives later in life simply because of the price. For example, President Trump is known as a burger lover. His financial status has minimal impact on his food selections. It would be more effective for people to voluntarily eat healthy foods and develop proper eating habits. Also the government should take some measures to make healthy food accessible to all sections of the society. People should also cultivate the habit of doing workout every day. As it is impossible to completely avoid junk food, people should try to neutralize some of the negative effects by doing regular physical activity.  To conclude, even though price adjustments can manipulate people’s food selections to some extent, the government should put more emphasis on public awareness. Once citizens realize the risks associated with junk foods, they are more likely to make voluntary changes to their food habits.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In recent times, more and more students are going abroad to pursue their university education. While studying in a different country can be beneficial, there are various drawbacks such as home-sickness and linguistic barriers. In my opinion, despite these downsides, there are huge career prospects associated with it. Most of the students move abroad for a high-quality education. In developing nations, education standards are not high when compared to developed countries. A recent survey showed that 70% of graduates in India move to either Australia, Canada or America for their Masters. Besides, most of the companies are looking for candidates who have a university degree from these countries. Furthermore, the student will get global exposure. They tend to meet people from diverse cultures and origins. Thus, it not only helps them to experience new things and learn from them but also improves their adaptability levels. However, students moving abroad can sometimes feel homesick. They tend to miss their family and it becomes difficult for them to concentrate on the studies. Therefore, affecting their education and daily lifestyle. Moreover, these people need to learn a local language in order to communicate effectively. For example, students of different nationalities in France, Germany and Italy need to learn their local dialect in order to speak. So, this might be an extra burden on the student as there are multiple subjects to learn at the university.  To conclude, although it is possible for a student to feel the pressure away from home and face difficulty communicating with the locals, I believe that there are high employment prospects and an excellent opportunity to learn new things.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Many people believe that education is an obstacle in their learning path and Einstein was one of them. Of course, he was one of the most intelligent people who ever lived on earth but Einstein often lamented that his education was hindering the process of his learning. If we examine this quote, it is not hard to see that there is some truth in it. Education, especially the conventional method of learning and teaching followed by schools and colleges, can hurt the intellectual development of students. It stifles creativity and imagination and tries to cast everyone in the same mould. That is mainly because schools teach the same subjects to all the students irrespective of their tastes. The problem with this system is that many of these subjects are actually useless to most of these students. For example, at school, all students are taught a lot of history, geography, science and mathematics. Someone who is interested in becoming a history teacher needs only a basic understanding of physics or mathematics. Yet, at school, all of these subjects are enforced on all children. Unfortunately, this over emphasis on teaching all that is there to learn prevents students from acquiring proficiency in the one or two subjects they are interested in. Also, our education system does not encourage creative thinking or experimentation. It is all about rote learning. However, this kind of learning cannot bring out the real talent of people. That probably also explains why some of the most successful people in the world were college dropouts. Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple and Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, were highly intelligent students who enrolled in prestigious institutions. Yet, they dropped out midway through the course because they realized that university was stifling their growth. After dropping out of college, they launched their own companies which eventually became pioneers in the field of innovation and changed the course of history. Had they stayed at university to complete their course, perhaps the Mac or Windows would not have been born. To conclude, Einstein was correct when he said that his education was a hindrance to his learning process.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The practice of putting animals in artificial zones away from their natural habitats has stirred up a controversy around the world. Some people believe that this has a devastating effect on animals but others see this as beneficial for endangered creatures. In my opinion, if given appropriate attention, zoos can contribute to saving the lives of rare animals. Both viewpoints will be analysed in this essay in more depth. On the one hand, some people see zoos as a cause of concern and dismiss / condemn the idea of keeping animals away from nature to live and breed in a limited space. This is because of the horrifying conditions of many zoos around the world especially in under developed areas, where animals are kept in dreadful conditions. For example, in 2007, three zoos in the USA were forced to close by the government after several reports claiming the outrageous treatment of animals came to light. Therefore, the viewpoint that sees zoos are cruel certainly holds water. On the other hand, many argue that zoos contribute to preserving animals which are on the verge of being extinct. This is because zoos protect those animals from illegal hunters, poachers and dangerous conditions. For instance, tigers and crocodiles are being killed for their skin to be sold in the black market. Were these animals left to live in their natural habitat, their extinction would be inevitable. Thus, keeping animals in the zoo is advantageous from this perspective. In conclusion, after analysing both sides of the argument, it seems to me that zoos play a key role in protecting animals. It is hoped that the rights and welfare of animals are prioritised by all organisations around the globe and zoos are kept under close scrutiny to ensure the safety of their animals.",8,False,72.72413793103448,296
"As per capita income of the world has been at its highest in the last decade, more travelers are visiting various tourist destinations than ever before. With this there is a growing perception that eventually English will become the only spoken language globally. Although it is true that when English becomes a common language we will have a much closer and understanding international community, it would certainly be at the expense of smaller indigenous people and their languages. Even though English is currently used for communication in most countries, there is still a wide disparity between the number of people who speak it and those who don’t. People native to South America or China still like to communicate in their local languages and possess little or no knowledge of English. If English becomes the primary language all over the globe, then it would certainly reduce the communication barrier between nations. With better understanding, more and more visitors would be willing to visit these countries and hence it can prove to be a boon for the local tourism industry. For example, countries like China and South Korea have been seeing significant fall in their annual tourism with tourists complaining that most common services like hotels, road signs and maps are not bilingual. On the other hand, electing English as the only spoken language around the world would certainly prove a threat to small cultures around the world, especially indigenous communities. Already one can witness that there are many tribes which are disconnected from the world, and if English were to become the main language, it would push those groups further away. If there is no support provided to market their local language and culture, their heritage would fade away by lack of visits from tourists. For instance, many small tribes living in Peru and islands of Japan see a lot of visitors who are very curious of their old and rich history.  In conclusion, with more and more tourists visiting various cultures and places, the rationale behind making English as a global language will only get stronger. This might prove effective in removing misunderstandings and communication barriers among the global community, but the cost of endangering future of indigenous communities is simply too high to pay.

"Most parents attempt to do what is best for their children’s proper development. Some people believe that teaching children to read early is going to help their future success. However, I do not agree with this notion. Reading skills are certainly important but in my opinion a 3 or 4 year old does not have to learn to read. I believe spending quality time with children and encouraging different play time activities are more / a lot more beneficial for the overall development of a child. In this essay, I will defend my stand / opinion with valid arguments. Firstly, we should understand that all children are different in terms of capabilities and needs. Hence compelling every child to learn to read from a very young age might prove to be counter-productive. While some children may take to this, others may develop apathy towards reading and this might prove to be a bigger problem when they start school. Furthermore I believe that if parents and teachers, engage young children in different interesting exercises, it is going to prove to be more fruitful than concentrating only on learning to read. For example, games like puzzles, coloring exercises and musical lessons are a lot more beneficial for the development of their motor and cognitive skills. In turn, this will have a better grip on their reading or speaking and they may learn to read or communicate even faster. Furthermore, I greatly support encouraging children to play outdoor games. This would enable them to be fit and also be in close proximity with nature which will enhance their social and cognitive skills all the more. Thus, I would like to conclude by saying that if parents give undue importance to introducing their child to reading at a young age, they may miss out on many fun activities. However, I also believe  that reading should be included in a toddler’s schedule so that they are used to books from an early age which is a very good habit to have for their bright future.

"A considerable / huge number of professionals like doctors and tutors are moving to developed nations. Brain drain causes numerous issues such as negligible development in the education sector and health care segment and downward economic development curve in the developing countries. I will discuss these problems in the subsequent paragraphs along with their corrective measures. The major problem that brain drain causes is the lack of development in education and health care sectors. For instance, as the creamy layer of educators and doctors move to other nations, the scope of development in the amelioration of public hospitals and government schools become static. As a result, their mother land cannot receive the required advancement in these sectors. Another possible impact is the downward trend in the economic progress of a country. Apparently, professionals are the assets of a country who play a crucial role in the economic development. So their migration to another country causes huge economic loss. First and foremost, the best solution to tackle this issue is to create jobs through the construction of public schools and health care centres which can generate work opportunities for these skilled workers. Apart from offering them a job, benchmarking of salaries to the international standard must be done so that they do not get attracted towards developed nations for higher packages. Moreover, to improve economic progression, authorities should make investments in existing schools and healthcare centres so that they meet global standards. If opportunities are available in their own country, young professionals will not want to leave for greener pastures.  To conclude, lack of opportunities is the main reason that encourages talented and ambitious young people to migrate to developed countries. Unfortunately, this migration hurts the development of their country and the only way to stop this is to make opportunities available for them within their own country.

"Some people insist that schools should offer comprehensive education which covers a variety of subjects, but others opine that studying a small range of subjects in depth gives students more benefits. On the one hand, comprehensive education helps realise students’ interests and potentials. Comprehensive education offers students a wide range of subjects, from which they can easily find out where their interests and potentials are. Students, especially senior school students, have to choose what to study at university so it is necessary for them to identify their true interests and goals. For example, if students have learned both science and arts subjects, they could easily decide whether they should choose biology or sociology as their majors at university. On the other hand, senior students who study specific subjects in depth stand a better chance of finding a good job. Learning specific subjects in detail can help students develop specific skills, which are essential for finding a job. More specifically, the student who is studying Java or C++ subjects deeply will have a higher chance of getting hired as a software engineer than their counterparts who just study general science courses. On balance, for the comprehensive development of students, the school should not only provide a well-rounded education, but also offer a few elective subjects for students to develop in-depth knowledge. For example, in China, most public senior high schools provide students with the N+1 model, which means various foundation subjects plus one specific subject. This model helps students find their interests as well as develop the skills needed for job search. This model has been awarded as one of the most successful education models in China.",8,False,73.6966093117409,276
"Family owned businesses are quite common in some countries. While some people believe that they have higher chances of success others opine that they are more likely to run into trouble. In my opinion, family businesses have some inherent advantages. However, disagreements between family members can lead to the disintegration of such entities. The biggest advantage that family businesses have over other businesses is that in a family owned business, people are working for themselves. This itself is a great factor that contributes to the success of a business. People tend to work harder when they work for themselves. Also when someone works for a family owned business, they have the support and encouragement of their family members. In addition, children born in business families learn the tricks of the trade from their childhood itself from their parents and grandparents. This exposure gives them a head start when they start their career and enables them to run the business more efficiently. Also working with family members for the common benefit of the whole family can be both fun and rewarding. In short, a family owned business has many advantages that a regular establishment lacks. On the flip side, some of the advantages of a family run business can turn out to be disadvantages if the members of the family are not careful. For example, younger family members are more likely to be irresponsible and immature. If they regularly turn up late for work or take too many holidays, it can lead to disagreements. Also, when someone works under their father or sibling, they are more likely to show a lack of seriousness. Unfortunately, this will hurt the prospect of the entire business. In addition, disputes between family members and ego clashes will run a family owned business into trouble. To conclude, after analysing both sides of the argument it is not hard to see that family owned businesses have several advantages over other types of establishments. However, families that run their own business must ensure that disagreements between family members are resolved before they turn into a business crisis. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is undeniable that companies nowadays ask applicants to fill the details about their personal choices and life such as their likes, dislikes and marital status. This practice is appreciated by a section of the society while opposed by others. Personally, I believe that revealing personal information anywhere in the job application is not beneficial. This essay will discuss both points of view, followed by a reasoned conclusion. On the one hand, there are many people who consider that providing personal information to employers is advantageous for them because it enables the company to offer incentives that suit the interests of the staff. For example, employers sometimes offer free memberships of clubs and gym fitness centers, which is definitely helpful for workers. In India, product-based companies, for example, take all the relevant information about an applicant before offering a job and after joining, these companies provide free gym access and certain discounts on various clubs according to employee’s areas of interest. Hence, giving personal information is beneficial to some extent. On the other hand, many consider these details irrelevant and I agree with these people. Firstly, during the application for a job, personal information does not play any role. To explain it in more detail, an application should have all the details about the candidate’s technical experience and educational details because a position is offered only on the basis of the candidate’s ability and not because he is married or sporty. Secondly, sometimes firms show bias when they learn about a worker’s marital status. For example, a bachelor / an unmarried person) can work in night shifts and he can work on weekends also because he is not married. Consequently, these companies may show a reluctance to hire married applicants. Therefore, making personal details available to companies could be harmful to workers. Also, companies do not need this information during the hiring process. To conclude, it is a common practice among companies to collect the personal information of their employees. However, I strongly believe that it is not helpful anywhere and sometimes it can have a negative impact on employees. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"One of the biggest dangers the mankind is facing nowadays is the climate change. Rather than fighting the climate change problem, some people are of the opinion that we need to survive amidst this. I totally disagree with this notion as we have numerous ways such as creating greener spaces to tackle this problem.  Why we need to struggle with the climate change when we can combat this issue with appropriate measures? Firstly, people need to be educated about the problem and ways to encounter it. For example, conducting awareness campaigns on the importance of creating greener spaces by planting trees and avoiding deforestation can effectively solve climate related issues. In addition, people should be encouraged to conserve energy and cut down on their consumption of fossil fuels. Limiting the use of private vehicles and taking public transport whenever possible is one of the many ways to reverse climate change caused by global warming.  Though the outcome of these measures is not immediate, it will definitely be fruitful in the years to come. If we do not take necessary actions at the earliest, the next generation will not have a habitable place to live in. In other words, our children will suffer from the disastrous impacts of climate change. Because of global warming, most of the countries across the world are already experiencing problems such as drought, forest fires, flooding and rising sea levels. If we start to act now, we will certainly have a better to place to exist in the future. In summary, I disagree with the opinion that we need to cope with / accept climate change rather than preventing it.

"While some people think that the increasing number of serious crimes can be tackled by offering death penalty to the offenders, others are of the opinion that some other measures are required. In my opinion, the government has to focus on certain measures to deal with the ever increasing number of serious crimes. On the one hand, some people believe that the crime rate will decrease if the government introduces certain measures. Firstly, vocational training should be offered to culprits while they serve their prison sentence. This will allow them to find a job after the completion of their sentence. Also when they are able to meet their needs, they are less likely to get into criminal activities in the future. Secondly, rehabilitation classes have to be conducted in prisons to educate the criminals about the aftermaths of crimes in the society. To elaborate they should be taught how crime affects the law and order situation of the society. Thirdly, the government has to organise campaigns to educate the public about the importance of accepting the criminals once they return to normal life after serving jail term. On the other hand, there are opponents who consider that capital punishment is the best way to deal with serious offences. It cannot be denied that dangerous crimes are on the rise as people think that death punishment is not awarded very often. Therefore, they argue that death penalty must be offered to crimes such as rape and terrorist activities to bring about peace and harmony in the community. In conclusion, even though people have diverse opinions about awarding capital punishment to deal with serious crimes, I think that measures such as offering vocational training and conducting rehabilitation classes in prisons will help to reduce the number of crimes to a certain extent.",7,False,67.43673312883436,300
"Several nations around the world support the idea of part time jobs for the teenagers as it is considered a wise and excellent way of personality development; however, others do not agree with the idea. In my opinion, youngsters should take up a part time job because it helps them to learn different aspects of life at a young age and also enhance their perspective.  On the one hand, some countries around the world consider part time job as an important way of learning whereby a teenager sees life in more complex ways and gains a sense of responsibility. Part time jobs help a teenager to feel independent and motivated to face future challenges by giving them firsthand experience in handling complex problems and situations at work. Moreover, it helps them understand the value of money. When teenagers get to manage their personal finances, they will also learn the importance of saving.  On the other hand, some countries do not consider part time jobs good for the teenagers because they consider it as an unnecessary burden on them and these jobs divert the teenager’s focus from academics to work. For instance, it has been observed over the years that countries which do not promote part time jobs have much less school or college dropout ratio among teenage students than the nations which support the idea. To conclude, there are many valid arguments in favour of both ideas but it is my strong conviction that part time job is necessary for the overall development of a teenager’s personality and nations should promote the concept of part time jobs in order to have more efficient and able workforce.

"Nowadays, it is commonly observed that most of the young kids are addicted to devices such as tablets, mobiles and iPods. In my opinion, excessive use of mobile devices has detrimental effects on children’s mental and physical well-being and hence parents should regulate their internet and mobile activity. This essay will give some guidelines regarding the correct use of mobile gadgets. Mobiles and the internet certainly help children in many ways. For example, mobile games such as ‘Word Finder’ help them to make simple words out of the given set of letters. This will enhance their thought process and thus increase their cognitive skills which are very essential for a successful life. Also, learning to use these devices from a young age makes them smarter and more comfortable with technology.  On the flip side, if children are always using their mobiles and tablets, they will develop several problems. For example, mobile addicted children may perform poorly in school because of their inability to focus on their studies. They may also become introverts. In addition, there is a possibility that they will come across harmful or obscene content on the internet. However, forbidding children to use the internet or the mobile is not the solution. Instead, parents should impose some strict rules on the mobile and internet use of their children. For example, parents should monitor their children when they are on the internet. They should also set a limit to the amount of time children can use these devices.   To conclude, computers and mobiles can be both good and bad for children. Children can not only gain vast amount of knowledge by using electronic devices but also improve their analytical and cognitive skills. However, addiction to mobile devices and electronic media is detrimental for their mental and physical development. Hence, parents should monitor their internet activity and limit their screen time.   Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Answer:  Recent studies have shown that the rate of obesity has increased drastically and it is leading to serious health issues. Nowadays, heart diseases and diabetes are common diseases due to this rapid increase in weight. Many factors such as a luxurious lifestyle, faulty eating habits and lack of exercise cause obesity and health problems. However, there are some solutions to these problems as well. This essay will take a look at this problem and its possible solutions. New developments in the field of technology have made our lives easier and more comfortable. Thanks to the availability of appliances like mixer grinders and washing machines, people can get everyday tasks done with hardly any physical effort / exertion. Therefore, they are becoming overweight day by day. Moreover, people prefer to eat junk food over healthy meat, vegetables and fruits. Fast foods contain a large amount of calories which people cannot burn / use up. The reason why only a few people suffered from obesity in the past is that they used to eat low calorie healthy food and burned those calories by engaging in physical activity. Unfortunately, now most people are busy their work that they do not have time to cook proper meals at home. Consequently, they eat junk food. On the bright side, there are some solutions to control this continuous increase in the number of overweight people. First of all, people should be encouraged to do regular exercise. This can be done by offering free gym sessions to the people who are obese and are at risk of developing serious illnesses. The government should begin awareness campaigns that guide people about the adverse effects of obesity on health and ways to fight against it. To conclude, excessive consumption of junk food and lack of physical activity are the main causes of the increase in the incidence of obesity.

"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.",8,False,90.3960979687194,338
"While some people regard physical education as a necessary component of schooling / school curriculum others opine that academics is of primal importance. Physical education makes children fit and helps them develop a sportive attitude, whereas academics helps the kids develop a good foundation for future career. Hence, I believe that a holistic environment consisting of academics and physical education must be provided to the children. Physical education aids people to become fit both physically and mentally.  In the current era of growing health concerns due to the sedentary lifestyle, doctors advise people to engage in regular physical activity. Furthermore, when people play a sport they become resilient and learn to cope with victories as well as losses. Involvement in sports helps the child develop team spirit. On the other hand, having good academic grades is crucial / essential for building a successful career. Being focused on studies leads to better conceptual understanding of the subject and one becomes more knowledgeable by learning new things. Also, having a good academic score increases the chances of being placed in better educational institutes in future and getting scholarships. I believe that the child’s education must have a comprehensive coverage of academics as well as physical education. The proverb, “All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy” is relevant in the current scenario. Asking the child to exclusively pursue academics can be taxing for them. Furthermore, only factual knowledge is insufficient for leading a comfortable life. In contrast, if a child is too focused on physical education, academics can get neglected leading to / and this could lead to poor scholastic performance. In conclusion, I opine that striking a balance between studies and sports is warranted for the better development of the child. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Visiting remote places is becoming more popular nowadays. This kind of tourism offers new opportunities to travellers but it also has its drawbacks. In this essay I shall discuss the advantages and disadvantages of visiting areas where conditions are rough. To begin with, certain landscapes and natural wonders located only in remote areas are unique and cannot be seen anywhere else in the world. No landscape is comparable to the Sahara desert or the Antarctic. If one wants to explore the wild nature and breathtaking scenery, one has to deal with difficult terrain. A clear example of that is the testimony of the Norwegian explorer Ann Straus. Straus, after enduring the perils of the Antarctic winter for 6 months describes in his biography one of the most beautiful sunrises ever seen by the human eye.  Thus, it is evident that there are some worthwhile places where conditions do not allow regular tourism. On the other hand, venturing into wild places can be extremely dangerous as well. Many rookie adventurers and travellers perished / lost their lives while exploring unexplored lands. For example, the Red Cross warned that in the last two decades the casualties related with this kind of tourism increased by 75%. It is not hard to see that sometimes the price for venturing into such areas is too high.  To conclude, some of the most beautiful landscapes on Earth are found only in extremely dangerous areas. While the memories of such trips will remain etched in the mind for a long time, they can be quite dangerous and the travelers may even lose their lives. In the future, perhaps some travel companies will organise tours to these locations so these gifts of nature could be safely enjoyed by everyone.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In today’s competitive world, employers want to be able to contact their employees no matter where they are in order to maintain smooth operations. This approach may have many positives, but it does have a few negatives as well. To start with, it is important to be able to contact an employee especially during difficult times at work on in case of an emergency. For example, hospitals need to be able to contact their staff in case of patient emergencies, trauma and calamities. This may help save a life or many lives. In times of troubleshooting certain tasks, a phone call or email may save a presentation, project or win a deal for an organization). Certain organizations, call centres for instance, need their staff on-call throughout the year. Any failure to do so may lead to loss of business and revenue. Contacting employees does not always benefit employers. To begin with, no employee likes to be contacted by their employer when they are at home or on holiday. This may invoke a feeling of resentment towards the employer. Some individuals are forced to work round the clock. They even take their work home. This leads to overworking, which may further lead to health risks and other related issues. Moreover, the employee may feel unhappy at his workplace and may even consider seeking job opportunities elsewhere. No employer benefits from an unhappy workforce as it may affect the growth and success of an organization.

"These days many employees lack interpersonal qualities such as communication skills and team spirit. This is due to the inadequate education system and recruitment procedures. In order to resolve this issue, amendments are required in the education policy and methods of teaching and assessing students. To begin with, the crucial reason for the lack of soft skills in fresh employees is the inefficiency of the education system. This is because the secondary and tertiary levels of education mainly focus on teaching theoretical subjects and no importance is provided to extracurricular activities. Secondly, many employers hire the workforce only on the basis of their academic scores. Therefore, the pressure to obtain maximum marks forces students to focus only on book learning. Consequently / as a result, most of the students lack the ability to work with team members and handle workplace pressures.  To combat this issue, the system of education should be amended to include soft skills as part of the curriculum. To elaborate, extra marks should be given for participation in sports, declamations, painting, dancing, and acting. This will encourage students to take part in these activities. As a result, students will become more confident, diligent, and co-operative team members. Additionally, the recruitment process should include group discussions and other tests measuring soft skills in order to select versatile candidates. For instance, Tata Consultancy Services selects the employees only after screening their soft skills, even if a candidate scores top rank in academics. This will ultimately motivate the students to work on their interpersonal skills. In conclusion, an inefficient educational structure and inept employee selection criteria are the reasons for the lack of interpersonal skills among employees.

"Scientists have been advising people to limit their consumption of energy so that environmental degradation can be reduced. There are several reasons why electricity is being over-consumed; however, given the worsening situation of the environment, the government should motivate people to use it less. People overuse electricity due to numerous reasons. Firstly, owing to the fast paced life, people want everything right away. For example, people these days use big machines to produce a lot of products at one time, use microwaves to quickly heat up the food and air conditioners to instantly cool down the room. Although people know how much devastation these appliances cause to nature, they use them to save time and for the sake of comfort. Another reason driving the consumption of electricity is the fact that almost every household has unlimited access to it. In that case, people use electricity according to their affordability and budget instead of their need. It is generally seen that the richer the person, the higher the electricity bill. Nevertheless, the governing bodies ought to take some steps to check this alarming issue. First and foremost, the government should make people aware of the importance of conserving energy by roping in environmentalists, renowned personalities and non-profit organizations working to conserve the environment. For instance, as people take the messages of their favorite celebrities seriously, they will implement their advice to their day to day life. Moreover, the government should fix an upper limit for electricity consumption. In this way, people would start considering electricity a vital asset and use it in accordance with their requirement. In conclusion, I restate that environment has been deteriorating at an alarming rate because of the availability of excess of electricity and people’s fast paced life.

"Education is crucial for the overall development of humanity. In most countries, both private and public institutions provide education. Some people believe that the government should be the only provider of education in a country. I completely disagree with this statement. This essay will discuss the importance of having both private and government educational institutes. When educational institutions are run by the government, every student will be able to access them. That is because government institutions provide education for free or at concessional rates. In India, for example, the government runs schools and colleges all over the country. Students who are below the poverty line can study at these institutions without paying any fee. The fee charged from other students is also nominal compared to the fee charged by private institutions. Obviously, there are several benefits when governments run educational institutes. However, the government cannot be the exclusive provider of education. The government has numerous other responsibilities as well. Also, there is a limit to the amount of money the government can invest in education. That is why it is important to allow private companies also to provide education. Of course, these institutions are unlikely to provide free education. However, they still provide quality education and students who can afford to pay the fee can enroll in these institutions. In a way, these institutions also take some load off government institutions. If everyone had to go to government schools, it would reduce the quality of education because of the inadequacy of resources. Also, when private schools operate in a country, the competition among them will indirectly improve the quality of education.  In conclusion, private education is not free but it is important to allow private companies to run educational institutes because the government alone cannot provide education to all the students in the country. Also, the presence of private educational institutes in the country will increase the quality of education because of the competition between them. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsMore and more young adults in our country are heavily indebted. Thus, it is considered by some that it should be mandatory to educate school children  the administration of money. In my opinion, people should not leave school without a sound knowledge of financial management.To begin with, a country’s development is strongly  upon the purchasing capacity of its inhabitants. That is to say, people who are in debt or financially vulnerable, would not be able to spend freely or invest, for example, in a new house, thus hindering the economic growth of the country. As a consequence, the rate of inflation would rise and people would be able to afford even less, which could ultimately result in the collapse of the entire economy. A good example of this vicious circle can be seen in countries such as Argentina, where people have to buy household items in the black market, because they cannot afford to buy them in regular stores due to skyrocketing prices. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to teach children early  money management.Another point to consider is the low standard of living that people have when they mismanage their finances. Individuals who are constantly short of money could eventually end up being socially isolated and unhappy, because they couldn’t afford to participate in leisure activities, such as going to the cinema with a friend, resulting in their  from social life. However, this could be avoided with ease by offering courses in money management.In conclusion, I strongly believe that school children should be taught how to manage their finances to prevent social isolation later in their life as well as to maintain the economic force of their country.",8,False,87.12848015942794,292
"Restricting air travel is the only way to prevent air pollution. Do you agree? Some people believe that the only way to avoid air pollution is limiting the air traffic. I disagree with this view. In my opinion, restricting air traffic will not completely prevent the pollution. Also it can have negative effects on the nation’ economy. To begin with, the main problem associated with aviation is the noise and gases emitted by the airlines. This pollution can be controlled to a certain extent by limiting the number of aeroplanes. But, it is almost impossible to prevent the pollution as the majority of the pollutants in the air do not come from the airlines. It may be due to other factors. For example, the increasing number of vehicles on the road or the human activity such as deforestation often causes more pollution than the air contamination due to flights. Therefore, it is evident that limiting air traffic is not the complete solution to deal with the air pollution. What’s more, restricting aeroplanes to prevent pollution can have many serious consequences on the country. First of all, the tourism industry will be affected due to the less availability of the airlines for the international or domestic passengers. International imports and exports of goods will also be affected. As a result, the country will not experience financial growth. Therefore, I believe that the governments of the countries  will not take such a risk by limiting  the air transportation when there are other options available . To conclude, it is evident that the idea of restricting the air traffic is not the best or workable solution for the problem of air pollution. Also, the consequences of such actions may adversely affect the country’s economy.",7,False,49.962246777163905,290
"Choosing a friend and maintaining that friendship is crucial for staying mentally healthy. Some believe that friends should accord with them on every single topic while others view disagreement as beneficial and even constructive in certain situations. In this essay, I will discuss both opinions and give my own opinion. To start with, opinions form characters and similar beliefs signify same characters. One of the advantages of having a friend with similar / same beliefs is that you can share hobbies and maintain your amity without fretting over quarrels and their grave repercussions. For instance, friends who agree that gambling in a poker game is ethically unproblematic can spend long hours together getting pleasure from the game without having to worry about the pangs of conscience. If these two friends had different stances towards poker, they would not be able to enjoy the game together. However, discord in friendship is essential for vital decisions in your life. Disagreement can shed light on those aspects of life you are unaware of and this can lead to success. For instance, while pondering over immigrating to Canada a couple of years ago, I sought consultation from friends who disagreed with me on dozens of issues. Despite this, I found their suggestions about employment opportunities practical as they enlightened me about the issues I had neither foreseen on my own nor received from friends similar to me in character. Had I not listened to their differing opinions, I would not have been able to find a proper job in such a short time after landing in Canada.  In conclusion, there are certainly benefits to having friends who share the same values and opinions as us; it is equally important to have friends who can offer a different perspective on things.

"The mother tongue is certainly the most important for any person; however, in order to get ahead in life and career it has now imperative for a person to speak at least one foreign language. Hence, I agree with the given argument.  There are multiple benefits to speaking a foreign language. These days more and more people are travelling to different countries to explore foreign culture, arts, food and other aspects of life. Travelling becomes a whole lot easier if they speak at least one foreign language. When travellers know the language of the country they travel in, they can easily interact with local people and build a healthy rapport with them. This makes travelling more enjoyable and even improves relation between countries. Likewise, it is important for students pursuing higher education abroad to speak at least one foreign language. Most foreign universities require international applicants to be fluent in a language like English. Being bilingual or multilingual also benefits the academic progress of students by helping them learn concepts faster. In addition, it helps them make friends abroad and thus overcome homesickness.  Proficiency in a foreign language also improves the career prospects of students. Employers, especially multinational corporations, give preference to candidates capable of speaking two or more international languages. These conglomerations have business interests all over the world and they want their staff to be able to converse with their counterparts working in other countries.  In conclusion, in this age of globalization it has become absolutely necessary for people to acquire proficiency in at least one foreign language if they want to prosper in their career. Learning a foreign language is also a great way to learn about a foreign culture and its people.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"According to some people youngsters should get advice from their seniors rather than their peers. I can only partially agree with this view. While I do admit that our elders are wiser and more experienced than us, they may not always be able to give advice that is appropriate for the age we live in.  On the one hand, our parents and grandparents have lived much longer than us. Thanks to the vast experience they have, they are a treasure of wisdom. Elders can be role models for young people who are still exploring the early stage of their life. Moreover, young people can learn from the mistakes of seniors. Getting advice from elders prevents them from going astray and committing the same mistakes that old people have made. On the other hand, since many old people had fewer opportunities to receive formal education, their thoughts tend to be more rigid and traditional. For instance, my 85-year-old grandmother still believes in the conservative Confucian theory that women are inferior to men. In her opinion, women should stay at home and take care of children. Furthermore, many seniors are highly superstitious and refuse to accept scientific wisdom. Many of them even refuse to consult a doctor when they fall ill and instead choose to follow some home remedies they learned from their parents. While some of these remedies have some scientific grounds, others are hazardous to our health and safety.  To conclude, old people are worthy of youngsters’ respect. There are always important lessons that young people can learn when seniors share their life stories. At the same time, their values and outlooks on life tend to be traditional and may not always suit our life and times.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"There is a controversial discussion about which subject should be of the greatest importance in school curriculum. Some people argue that history, which is about the past, should be viewed as the priority in primary education; whilst other people believe that Science and Technology are more critical. In my opinion, despite the fact that history should be taught as a compulsory subject, practical courses about science and technology are more crucial for students’ future development.  There is no denying the fact that history helps young people understand their culture and gives them identity. The young generation can grasp an in-depth understanding about how their culture and country have evolved over the centuries from studying history. Meanwhile, it gives young people a sense of belonging. For example, in China, students study history which is dated back / which dates back to 1000 BC and they feel honoured about the ancient Chinese civilisation. Therefore, I believe history is an important way for people to remember the past and discover their cultural identities.  Although history is still needed in school curriculum, science and technology related subjects are of the paramount importance because they can greatly enhance students’ career development. In this era, students who are equipped with profound knowledge in the field of advanced technology or science are popular in the job market. In fact, very few history students can find a good job. A survey conducted by Harvard University shows that the employment rate of students majoring in computer science is 30% higher than that of students having history degrees. It is clear that learning Science and Technology will give students a head start and helps them become successful in their career. This can be viewed as the most important outcome for most families and modern education.  In conclusion, this essay agrees with the argument that schools as well as students should devote more resources and time to Science and Technology. Meanwhile, history should still be maintained as a mandatory topic for every student. In this way, students will not only be equipped with knowledge about their culture and identity but also be educated with the most critical knowledge in the future job market.

"Financial management is a useful skill that everyone must have. Many people argue that secondary school students should be taught money management at school. I agree with this view.  To commence with, teaching teenagers about saving and managing money can help them to understand its value. At this age most of them are already aware of the financial status of their family. They know how hard their parents work to send them to school and provide them other amenities. Also, most children receive some pocket money when they are in high school. If they have money management lessons in their syllabus they will figure out the best way to use their pocket money. These lessons will give children an understanding of the need to budget everything. They will also learn about the functioning of national and international economies. Better still, they will learn to respect the efforts put in by their parents.  In addition to this, schools can enhance the money management skills of young people by allowing them to run a canteen or other services inside the school campus. They can also start a saving scheme for students and encourage them to deposit their pocket money in it. Schools should also encourage financially well-off students to help their underprivileged peers by helping them pay their fee or buying them textbooks. To conclude, money management is all about making the best use of the available resources. It takes only a few years for teenagers to become adults and if they did not figure out how to manage their finances at high school, they will struggle as adults when they have to manage everything on their own. Hence, I believe that high school students should be taught financial management.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"More and more multinational companies are setting up their branches / offices in developing countries. The primary advantage of having large scale industries is that they will increase employment and reduce poverty, but the main drawback is that they force employees to work hard. Global organizations often bring employment to developing nations. Nowadays, every nation produces a lot of doctors, scientists and engineers but fails to give them a deserving job. When multinational companies set up their offices in developing nations, talented and educated people get good jobs. For example, a study conducted by Times reported that Indian graduates from STEM do not like to leave their nation in search of better opportunities in foreign nations because they are able to find suitable jobs within the country. Moreover, big industries create jobs not only for skilled workers but also for unskilled workers. China is another example. It is known as a manufacturing hub because companies like Apple and Google manufacture their products there.  However, the major drawback of multinational company investment is that employees are forced to work harder and yet they are paid less than their counterparts in developed countries. Many times employees complain that their employers compel them to work overtime to meet their targets. For instance, Indian Multinational IT industries force their employees to work more than 8 hours to complete their tasks to hand over assignments to the clients located across the Atlantic. In conclusion, global companies in developing nations bring jobs to the skilled and unskilled labor and help individuals live the good life, but they also force them to change their lifestyle by asking them to work overtime.",7,False,79.33333333333334,272
"Some people believe that music should not be part of the school curriculum, and only other subjects such as information technology, science and math should be taught. In my opinion, music might not be a subject that can directly help individuals in their professional life, yet there are indirect benefits that make music indispensable. Admittedly, people who claim that music should not be taught at school believe it is no longer a subject that provides individuals with skills required to generate a sustainable income. Moreover, they think that the current job market favours professions related to artificial intelligence, mobile applications, finance and economy. These occupations require knowledge in subjects such as information technology, math and science. On the other hand, although music might not open the doors to a successful career, it has an important influence on individuals and supports them in their personal and professional life. First, music helps the mental and spiritual growth of people. It is proven that listening to or playing certain kind of music helps individuals to relax, reduce stress and focus on their work. Secondly, music makes considerable contribution to enhancing the health of human beings. Many Medical studies have proven that playing certain music instruments reduces heart rates and blood pressure. For these reasons music will always be an essential subject that humans should not ignore. It helps them to find their inner peace and supports them in doing other activities and facing challenges. In conclusion, I believe music might not be the subject that directly helps students in their future professional career; however, music can give important contribution to human’s spiritual and mental health which makes it indispensable.",8,False,94.11979641799165,276
"Nowadays, the internet is used by many people to find detailed information about history and culture. It is claimed by some that museums are no longer required as all the information is available on the internet. I personally disagree with this. The following paragraphs essay will discuss why museums are essential.  To begin with, no one can deny the fact that people cannot physically see historical artifacts on the internet. It only provides photos which most of the time are not enough to understand the actual size and beauty of the artifacts or sculptures. For example, in order to gauge the actual size of the biggest sword made in the 19th century, you have to see it in person. Photos on the screen can never give an accurate idea of the size. Secondly, every bit of information available on internet may not be true as some websites put up wrong information for their benefit. Conversely, museums contain information curated by the government and history experts. This will help people get actual understanding of historical events.  In addition, museums buttress economical development in the city. To explain it in detail, the fees collected from visitors of museums would increase the revenue of the government. It is not only a source of income for the government, but also provides entertainment to some people. Historical museum buildings attract a plethora of visitors. For instance, science and industry museum in Chicago attracted 1 million visitors last year. This increased the popularity of Chicago around the world.  From what have been discussed above, I strongly disagree with the idea that museums are not required. In my opinion, the internet will never be able to physically show things. Museums provide true representation of history, culture and religion which would not be possible with internet.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Women often leave their career behind for bringing up / raising their children and to take care of the elder members of the family. Some people argue that the government should financially assist them to make the society equal. I disagree with this statement since it will adversely impact the national budget and influence working women in a negative way. Providing some sort of monetary assistance to women who have given up their job will put a tremendous load on the country’s financial resources. Countries such as India and Pakistan are already struggling with basic problems such as poverty and food scarcity. Hence, the government’s priority should be eradicating such issues rather than providing unemployment allowance to young mothers.  Moreover, if the government decides to give a monthly salary to women who quit their job for taking care of their family, it will create resentment among other women who work a job. If they can earn a salary without going to office, then all of them will definitely resign from their jobs to be stay-at-home mother. Eventually, the government will end up paying all women for staying home. Thus, obviously, providing wages to mothers who stay at home is not good for a nation’s economy. To conclude, assisting women who left their jobs to take care of their families with salaries is not a good approach. I believe that the government should provide them other forms of assistance such as free medical assistance and insurance. It should also enact policies that allow young mothers to work from their home and earn a salary.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"There is no denying the fact that human activity has caused considerable damage to plants and animals / wildlife. An army of people hold the view that nothing can be done about this, while others believe that the government has to take some measures to deal with this danger. In my opinion, change will occur only with the joint effort of the society and the authority. There are people who state that change will occur if the government enacts laws to protect the environment. I agree with this. There is no doubt that some measures should be taken to tackle the issues faced by animals and plants. Afforestation, for example, is one of the viable solutions to deforestation which has a direct impact on plants and animals. Moreover, the government has to conduct campaigns in schools and other public gathering places to educate the population about the importance of plants and animals on earth. Beyond that, authorities can keep animals, which are on the verge of extinction in zoos. Of course, there are people who believe that it is impossible to create any change since humans are materialistic in nature and do not much care about animals and plants. Moreover, the government’s primary priority is always the well-being of humankind as such they hardly take actions for the preservation of endangered species. In conclusion, even though people have diverse opinions about the need to protect endangered plants and animals, I strongly support the view that some measures have to be implemented in order to create a stable environment for the wildlife to survive.",8,False,76.44044179741323,262
"Nowadays, the use of solar energy has increased at an impressive rate. For many people, it is better to use solar energy than any other form of energy source. However, there are both pros and cons to deciding to do so.  In this essay, I will discuss some of the reasons for the widespread use of solar energy and some of the challenges to be overcome. The obvious reason for the large scale utilization of solar energy is its advantages such as eco friendly properties, cost efficiency and ease of production. Solar energy does not cause environmental pollution unlike fossil fuel energy, which is the main source of emission of dangerous gases such as Co2 causing global warming and climatic changes. In addition, no extra payment is required once the solar system is installed. So it is cheap to produce and utilize. For instance, the fossil fuel production and distribution requires highly expensive machines and massive manpower.  Turning to the other side, due to the modernization of all house hold equipments and introduction of new kitchen appliances, the consumption of energy has increased compared to olden times. Since the solar energy depends on the availability of sunlight, the production rate is not sufficient enough to meet the entire needs of a house. The availability of sunlight is not uniform throughout the year in all parts of the world. For example, in Canada the availability of sunlight is less. Generally speaking, solar is not a viable energy source in cold countries that receive sunlight for only a few hours a  day. All things considered, in comparison with other sources of energy, solar energy is clean, cheap and easy to produce provided that sufficient amount of sunlight is available. Personally I believe benefits of solar power eventually outweigh the negatives.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Cities are home to a large number of people and hence it is crucial to build a convenient mode of transportation in cities. Some people argue that of the options in public-transport, a metro is the easiest way to reach various places in the same city. I strongly agree with this view and in this essay I will support my stand with valid arguments. To start with, metro fares are considerably low in large cities. This is because the main intention of the public transport department is to serve the public, irrespective of their financial status. For example, in major cities like Seattle, New York and Los Angles, the average metro fare is approximately $2.75. Consequently, even weaker sections of the society can access them. By contrast, it is expensive to travel by other means of transportation like taxies or private buses. That explains why more and more people use the metro now. Moreover, metros are frequently available to all major destinations with less waiting period. The reason for this is that due to the high population in many cities, the transportation department has doubled the number of metro trains to meet the demand. For example, according to a survey conducted by a reputed firm in London, the frequency of metro trains has increased over the last five years and now they run every 15 minutes. Consequently, many urban residents have ditched their private vehicles in favour of metro. To conclude, after analysing the situation it is not hard to see that the metro is the cheapest and most reliable mode of transportation is cities.",8,False,68.33518530804223,263
"The issue of poverty is increasing at an alarming rate throughout the world. Owing to this, the wealthy people are increasingly growing wealthier and the condition of the impoverished is worsening. This essay will discuss the major reasons behind this situation and will propose some measures to ameliorate it. One of the major issues caused by such a big financial gap between the two sections of the society is the social imbalance and the subsequent exploitation of the weaker section of the society. As all the power lies in a handful of people, the economy of such countries are dominated by them. As a result, they neglect the others and the condition of the poor degrades even more. For instance, in Zimbawe, the whole economy of the country depends on two dominant business tycoons for economical growth and job opportunities and the families of them are given royal treatment; however, their attitude towards the impoverished is awful. To avoid such situations, the government should take measures to provide basic resources such as education to the economically deprived. Additionally, the authorities should give fair job opportunities to such people. For instance, a certain percentage of seats should be reserved in schools, colleges and work places for the poor people. Secondly, the government should decide a threshold beyond which the rich people cannot earn, and if they do so, they have to invest that much amount for the upliftment of the underprivileged section of the society. In conclusion, as the gap between the rich and the poor is increasing in some countries, the poor section of the society has to face major issues of ill-treatment and the balance of the society is also disturbed. To overcome such situations, the government should understand the gravity of the situation and act wisely and in favour of all citizens.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"People’s opinions seem to differ on whether spending money lavishly on celebrations and special occasions is a positive trend or a mere wastage of money. While some seem to agree with the argument that it is necessary for the society, I believe that such unmindful spending should rather be avoided. To begin with, there are myriad reasons to argue that spending loads of money on weddings and other special occasions is quite unnecessary. Firstly, in most of today’s celebrations there is a deliberate show of power and easy money. Such extensive celebrations are no better than pomp shows. Secondly, instead of spending huge amounts of money on any celebration, it is better to save it and later invest it in better ways. For instance, instead of spending lots of money on a child’s first birthday party in a five-star hotel, it is better to save it for his/her higher education. Furthermore, sometimes spending on special occasions like birthdays, anniversaries and housewarming also become a social obligation for many people and they give in to the societal pressure spending their hard-earned money. On the other hand, people who argue that it is imperative to have grand celebrations opine / insist that it is a way of enjoying life with their family and friends. They feel that such celebrations are part of their customs and traditions. While this may be true to a certain extent, in my opinion, there is no need to spend truck loads of money on celebrations. For example, a birthday party held at home can be as enjoyable as the one held at a five star hotel and yet it costs much less. To conclude, I feel that unmindful spending on any occasion can be avoided. Instead that money should be saved or used in a better way.",8,False,74.90042993047933,299
"There is no doubt that famous sports personalities and film stars undergo numerous problems and benefits for being celebrities. The main problem is that their privacy gets invaded; however, in my opinion, the advantages of being a famous personality, such as wealth and popularity certainly surpass any of its disadvantages.  To begin with, undoubtedly, the private lives of famous television and sports stars are always invaded by others. In other words, owing to their popularity, the public is often keen to know about the happenings in the day to day life of these personalities. As a consequence, most of them are followed by paparazzi all the time, which usually affects their personal life. To exemplify, according to a report by the New York Times, the late actress Marilyn Monroe, used to hide in her house for several days to avoid paparazzi. Thus, extreme popularity does not allow celebrities to enjoy the sort of privacy that an ordinary person enjoys.  Nevertheless, despite the aforementioned drawback, a strong case for being a celebrity can be drawn. The crucial advantage is that most of the celebrities earn huge amount of money for their work. As a result, they often become millionaires overnight and this allows them to buy whatever they want for themselves and their loved ones. To exemplify, the captain of Indian cricket team Virat Kohli has a fan following throughout the world and, moreover, he ranks 5th in the list of millionaires in India. Hence, being a celebrity makes an individual wealthy enough to live a luxurious life. In conclusion, although popularity affects the private lives of celebrities, in my opinion, the merits of acquiring wealth and appreciation far outweigh its demerit.

"It is an undeniable that people tend to migrate to industrialized nations for better employment opportunities. It is also true that this phenomenon hinders the progress of their own nation in many ways. For example, it affects the availability of skilled manpower in their motherland. The issue of brain drain has always been of paramount importance. People tend to move to the developed countries for getting a handsome salary that justifies the amount of hard work they did to earn their degrees. Actually, this prospect of settling abroad lures many students to work harder at university. For example, medical education is highly expensive and requires a great deal of hard work. If a medical student is convinced that upon completing her education she can find a lucrative job in a foreign country she will be more encouraged to put in all those efforts required to be a doctor. Moreover, when skilled professionals migrate to a developed country they will get to further enhance their skills because of the opportunity to work with some of the best minds in the world. On the other hand, it cannot be denied that brain drain affects the quality of living in poor countries. For example, many doctors of Indian origin have moved to developed countries like the US and the UK. As a result, there is a dearth of qualified medical professionals in the country. This hurts the Indian health sector and puts the lives of many people at risk. To conclude, there is no denying the fact the migration of skilled human resources to developed countries hurt the overall progress of their mother country.

"Teleworking has become more popular in recent times. In my point of view, working from home has significant benefits in terms of time management; however, it reduces human interactions considerably. In this essay, I will discuss both sides using examples to support arguments and demonstrate points. On the one hand, the main positive benefit of working remotely is that employees can save time and money on their daily commute. This is largely because employees spend an important amount of time just moving from one place to another. This time can be better invested in completing tasks at home. For example, according to “Employee First Magazine” there is a new law project in Italy that aims to include commuting time within the working hours. Therefore, teleworking allows people to spend time efficiently. On the other hand, despite the fact that people can be more efficient at home, workplaces give the opportunity to have human interactions. This is due to the fact that building relationships with colleagues is essential in order to reduce depression or even suicides, because people can talk face to face about their problems. For instance, a recent study by Colorado University has shown that working from home can increase the risk of depression by 12%. Thus, freelancing limits the social interactions of employees. To conclude, from the examples and arguments given above, I firmly believe that working from home has some benefits. For example, it allows employees to save time. At the same, it has some drawbacks in that it reduces interactions among people.",7,False,86.328125,255
"Obesity has become a common problem in western societies and this is partly due to the availability of fast food at low prices. To tackle this problem, it has been suggested that governments should increase the tax on fast foods in order to reduce the amount of pre-cooked meals consumed. I personally believe that this is a sound idea, because especially young people, who have less money, will be discouraged from buying food at quick service restaurants.The main reason for the high consumption of junk food is that it is a cheap alternative to healthy meals. A salad for example often is twice as expensive as a burger, resulting in more people eating the burger than the salad. As a result, people prepare fewer meals themselves and eat more mass-produced food instead. In my opinion, it should not be possible to sell fast food at a lower price than staple food. By making takeaway meals more expensive than vegetables and fruit, people would change their eating habits, as they would want to save money.Another way to reduce consumption of fast food would be to prohibit its promotion. A similar approach was taken in terms of advertising cigarettes and one can say that this approach has been successful to some extent. Additionally, commercials for fast food often target young children through offering inducements, such as the toys in the happy meal at McDonalds for example. The children are persuaded to demand a happy meal, yet often do not necessarily want to eat the food contained in it. The only thing they want is the toy. If advertising junk food were forbidden, the number of children consuming pre-cooked meals would be reduced and therefore the number of obese children would decrease as well.In conclusion, governments should put a tax on fast food to reduce the amount consumed in order to decrease the number of obese people. By placing a tax on fast food and making it more expensive than healthy raw foods, people would began to eat more healthily. If additionally the advertising of quick service restaurants were banned, the number of obese people would decrease even more drastically.",9,False,71.4,357
"Traffic and pollution have significantly increased over the years.  Some people believe that raising the price of petrol would resolve such issues. I completely disagree with this idea. This essay will elaborate on the reasons why and suggest possible solutions to minimize pollution and traffic congestion. I believe hiking the cost of petrol is not a viable solution that can be implemented globally. It is unlikely to deter wealthy people who own a fleet of cars from driving their own vehicles. Consequently, this move will fail to reduce the number of private cars on roads. At the same time, it will make life miserable for poor people by causing an increase in the price of essential commodities. Needless to say, increasing the cost of petrol will neither solve traffic problems nor reduce air pollution.  Instead of raising the price of fuel, the government can take some other measures to effectively tackle this problem. First, corporate companies whose employees require only a computer to do their work should allow them to work from home at least 3-4 days a week. This would reduce the carbon footprint of daily commuters traveling for work. Another solution is that governments should create new laws that would restrict the number of vehicles a household can own. This would curb unnecessary spending on new cars and motorbikes. Both these solutions can positively impact the environment while discouraging excessive use of vehicles. Improving the frequency and reliability of public transport is another way to discourage the use of private cars. In conclusion, air pollution and traffic troubles cannot be resolved by just increasing the cost of fuel. Instead the government should make public transport more reliable and promote work from home options to reduce people’s need to travel.",8,False,101.46586924148534,290
"Capital Punishment has always been a subject of long and grueling debates amongst intellectuals and philosophers since the dawn of history. Supporters of capital punishment argue that such a method of punishment is very effective in deterring criminals from committing murder. Also, from justice point of view, capital punishment is regarded as the just and logical punishment for murderers. As for the victim’s family, it serves as an opportunity to take revenge for their murdered loved ones. However, critics view capital punishment as immoral. Since killing as an act on its own is a condemned one, this exclusive right of the government to kill would spark many moral dilemmas. In addition, statistics have proved that capital punishment, regardless of the method, has failed to control the number of murder cases in many countries. In reality, there has been no established pattern that would support the claim that capital punishment serves as a tool to reduce murder cases. For example, in Scandinavian countries, where capital punishment had been abolished, the number of murder cases per capita is one of the least in the world. Hence, it is hard to say that capital punishment was the reason for this astounding result. In a country like the USA, murder cases are numerous despite capital punishment. In conclusion, Capital punishment has failed to serve its purpose. This established through facts and statistics. In addition to being an immoral method of establishing order, it portrays governments as criminals. It is rather prosperity that can control violence in the world. After all, humans tend to do the right thing; it is circumstances that compel them to commit the evil.",7,False,51.48506493506493,273
"It is true that consumer goods these days are cheaper than they used to be in the past. Though there are various advantages associated with this, the drawbacks of cheaper consumer goods still outweigh them. When consumer goods can be bought at cheap rates, their consumption increases.  While this is good for the economy, it hurts the environment because more resources are required to produce more goods. This does not help the planet. Another downside of excessive consumption is that it leads to the production of more waste. Actually, garbage disposal is one of the biggest issues we face today. Landfills all over the world are already overflowing. Oftentimes perfectly usable products are thrown away because a slightly better and newer version of the same product has already hit the market and can be bought for the same price. For example, many people these days change their mobile phones every two months. This trend is fuelled by the cheap prices and in my opinion it benefits neither the consumer nor the environment.  Of course, there are some benefits to having cheap consumer products. For example, now mobile phones are quite cheap and consequently almost everyone owns a phone these days. This is certainly advantageous. When mobile phones first became available in the market, they were ridiculously pricey and only the rich could afford to buy them. This was the case with most electronic products ten or fifteen years ago and they had a created a society of haves and have nots. Fortunately, that is not the case today and now regardless of your financial status, you have access to modern technology and other innovations. In conclusion, cheap consumer goods are certainly beneficial but there is an urgent need to reduce their consumption. While I can understand the argument that everyone should have access to every product in the market, in my opinion, mindless consumption fuelled by cheap prices is in nobody’s interest.

"In recent years, several educational institutions are conducting online sessions to offer certifications without requiring the student to pursue on-campus study. Although there are demerits to this trend, they are overshadowed by the merits.  On the one hand, the predominant benefit of distance education is that it is accessible to all income groups. Mainly, most of the people from low-income groups cannot afford to attend full-time courses as they are extremely expensive. However, with the availability of these online educational programs, a person from any financial group can get a qualification without having to worry about the cost. Another additional advantage of online study programs is that it is feasible for students to attend them from any corner of the world. For instance, in order to attend college, students need to relocate to university campus and work part-time to pay for their expenses. Contrary to this, students from other nations can just utilise a good internet connection and join the classes. On the other hand, there is a significant shortcoming to this modern day pedagogical approach. In other words, the standard face-to-face communication is not possible, which makes it difficult to monitor whether students are focusing on the lectures or not. Because of this, even if individuals gain an online qualification, the extent of subject knowledge they have is uncertain. In conclusion, there are merits and demerits to distance learning. I believe it is a boon to financially deprived students who live in different countries and this eclipses the downsides of this method of learning. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to some people, parents are the most influential people in a child’s life; others insist that friends and gadgets like television have a greater impact on them. In my opinion, parents are certainly important in a child’s life but now friends and media are becoming even more influential. Parents are important. After all, they are the first teacher and the role model of a child. Children learn much of the social skills from their parents. In fact, the atmosphere at home plays a crucial role in shaping their character and personality. That also explains why kids born to successful parents also become successful in their life. Likewise, kids coming from dysfunctional families are more likely to have personality problems. Even so, in this age of information explosion parents are becoming less influential. To start with, most parents are now busy and get to spend only a small amount of time with their children. Now, the television has assumed the role of the baby sitter. Children spend enormous amounts of time in front of the TV and get influenced by the programmes on it. Consequently, their understanding of the world is now shaped more by the programmes they watch on television than by their parents. Friends are even more influential than gadgets. Children spend a great deal of time with their peers at school and outside of it. It is quite natural for them to get influenced by their friends. Every child wants to be popular among their friends. Actually, many children are willing to even disobey their parents to impress their friends. To conclude, parents are slowing losing their influence on children because they do not manage to spend adequate time with them. Not surprisingly, friends and gadgets are replacing parents as the greatest influence on children.",9,False,56.608032128514054,298
"The significance of reading books has never been overlooked by any society. However, since the invention of TV sets, the habit of reading has been losing its popularity. While people can benefit from watching TV to some extent, I believe that it is reading that enhances our imagination and helps us acquire more language skills. Reading books is a great way to develop children’s intelligence and language skills. The major reason is that words enable readers to visualize what they read, and there is no restriction to / limit to such imaginative thinking. This subsequently enables book readers to assimilate information and build a world of fantasy. In addition, reading is an effective way of improving written language proficiency. The perfect example is that children who read extensively tend to have a higher level of writing skills than those who spend much of their time watching TV. Admittedly, watching TV can more or less make people knowledgeable and expressive. By watching different channels, viewers are likely to gain a wealth of information so that they can have a broader understanding of the world they live in. What is more, different TV programs are presented in languages of different styles, and therefore watchers can effectively enlarge their vocabulary. However, the sounds and photographs on TV can do harm to people’s imagination because when they watch a program, it is scientifically proven that their brain is hardly engaged. Consequently, this passive method of absorbing information undermines intellectual development of the viewer in the long run.  To summarize, people should be encouraged to read books rather than watching TV as it allows more freedom for readers to imagine and improve their linguistic abilities. Watching TV can also be a great way to increase people’s knowledge, but people need to be mindful of the adverse impacts it has on them.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The education system witnessed dramatic changes during the past century. There is a common belief that schools should focus more on academic subjects and less on the practical skills of a student. I fully disagree with this opinion and I think that children should be taught basic skills such cooking at schools. I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs. There is no doubt that academic subjects such as mathematics and science should be given more importance in the school curriculum. These subjects help children develop logic and understand the world around them. Additionally, academic knowledge is a good basis for a future career. However, not every student will pursue a career in science and each of them will need to cook at some stage of their life. For example, after graduation from school, many students move out of their parents’ house and start living on their own. Those In such situations, those young people who have never even fried an egg face serious difficulties. Had they learned cooking at school, this could have been avoided.  Cooking is not only a survival skill but it is also) fundamental for health and wellbeing. According to research, the people who know cooking and practice it on a daily basis have the lower risk of diabetes and colon cancer than the people who do not know how to cook and prefer to eat fast food. Children should learn how to prepare healthy and nutritious meal for themselves and the school should help them to gain this skill. Every school should have classes where children have an opportunity to learn simple recipes and under the teacher’s supervision. From my personal experience, I learned how to make soup at school and I appreciate this experience because it helps me now.  In conclusion, I believe that the school should take the responsibility to educate children on some practical activities such as food preparation. Although academic knowledge is absolutely necessary for a modern human being, cooking is a survival skill and a protective factor against some health issues.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Modern technology helps people live a lot easier, although it has a number of disadvantages. The fantasy vision of robots controlling major parts of human lives is slowly becoming a reality. Unemployed people blame the government for allowing this situation to spiral out of control but opinions are divided. Unemployment in 21th century is far higher than what it was a couple of decades ago. Inventors work really hard to develop new machines and robots. The trend of saving money on labour has dramatically increased and this can be noticed on a daily basis. People use all of the inventions every day, but they are starting to see the downsides of machines as well. New self-checkout machines in most supermarkets have replaced over 50 percent of old fashion cashiers. In some countries the train drivers has been replaced by self-driving trains. Now many of us are withdrawing money through cash machines. Looking at this trend one might assume that technology has increased the number of people without jobs. However, it is not quite true. The machines have considerably improved our standard of life. They haven’t killed jobs. Actually, it is safe to claim that the new technologies have created new professions. Every machine requires regular service and repairs, so engineers are in high demand. Most of the new technologies need to be constantly improved by inventors. This gives new career opportunities for the youngsters, and university teachers.  Fewer labourers means less costs and lower final product price. The number of advantages is far higher than disadvantages. Using all of the inventions and blaming them for the loss of jobs is hypocrisy.

"Advancement in technology has made it possible to shop online. A number of people like to purchase food from nearby supermarkets and local vendors. On the other hand, a group of people prefer to shop food from online stores. I would like to discuss both practices in this essay. To begin with, online shopping for food has become common in busy cities because it satisfies the lifestyle needs of the people and eliminates the need to travel long distances to supermarkets in heavy traffic. Moreover, when people shop online they have the option of comparing prices and this enables them to get the best deal. Apart from that, prices of online food are much cheaper than prices in supermarket because they do not require a large storage space and staff for maintenance.  For instance, the number of supermarkets closing their operations has increased because of the competitive prices and discounts offered by the online stores. However, the traditional way of purchasing food from local vendors or supermarkets is still popular among others. This has some pros like an opportunity to taste different kinds of food before purchasing them and ensuring the quality of the product. Also, when we buy from a physical store we can even taste the aroma of the food and decide whether we want to buy or not. The major drawback of shopping at supermarkets is that it is a time consuming and tedious task to find the products.  In conclusion, buying food online is more advantageous than buying it from supermarkets because it saves consumers both time and money.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"No doubt, nowadays youngsters are attracted towards the sports programmes that are being telecasted on television. According to some people, the poor health of youngsters is due to the fact that they only watch these programmes without actively participating in them. I disagree with this view as such programmes encourage young people to play and teach them rules of the game. To start with, one good reason for watching sports channels is that it kindles the enthusiasm to stay fit by playing sports. To be more precise, when people watch sports events they develop an opportunity to learn about their sports personalities playing in different corners of the world and their fitness levels. This will motivate them to form teams to play sports and stay fit and healthy. For instance, people in India have developed a natural attraction towards cricket owing to the channels that preferentially telecast cricket as it is sponsored by major corporate. This interest has resulted in the birth of multiple state and district level teams involving a lot of youngsters.  Another good point in favour of sporting events on television is that they help people to gain knowledge about the sports rules. Sports events are organised both nationally and internationally and through the live telecast of such events, beginners who want to take up sports as a career can learn the rules of the game. To illustrate this, in one of his interviews, Rafael Nadal, who is an internationally acclaimed tennis star, revealed that he learnt the rules of tennis by watching tennis matches on the TV during his childhood days.         Lastly, sports shows on television increase the popularity of the game. Kabadi, for example, is an indigenous Indian game which was losing popularity after cricket arrived in the sub continent. Now, Kabadi matches on television have rekindled people’s interest in this game. Likewise, Baseball is now played in many different parts of the world. Previously, it was played only in the USA. To sum up, I disagree with the opinion that watching games on television contributes to ill health among youngsters since it promotes increased physical activity by not only kindling interest in the games among younger people but also by teaching them the rules of sports.

"We are living in the 21st century. There are many people who use online communication tools like Facebook, Gmail and Yahoo. Online communication is becoming more and more popular. It has many advantages and disadvantages. Nowadays people like online communication because there are many advantages. The rates are cheap. It uses modern technology. You can just fire up Skype or another communication app on your laptop and do video chat. These days we can communicate with our relatives through email which reach the recipient immediately. We can also send pictures and videos online. They help to maintain our relationships. Online video chatting also helps us to interact with new people and make new friends.

Hackers create a lot of problems all over the world. To conclude, online communication has both advantages and disadvantages. However, in my opinion, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

"The population is increasing day by day and building housing / homes for all the people has become a major cause for concern. According to some people, new homes should be built within existing cities; however, others opine that new residential colonies should be built to house people who do not have a roof over their head. In my opinion, both options have their merits and demerits and the government should consider them both. Expansion of existing city is a good idea as it is already functioning and has proper infrastructure. If more people join this group, there will not be any discomfort. In fact, they will also contribute towards the development and economic growth of that area by serving and paying taxes. Therefore, this would be a cheaper, easier and convenient way of accommodating the growing population. However, the government should monitor the number of occupants because over occupancy may deteriorate the quality of people’s lives in these areas. On the other hand, building new towns is a great option if implemented in the right manner. If the government takes care of the industrial and agricultural development of a place, a new town can take birth. Also, this will generate a huge number of employment options. In addition, the creation of new small towns will discourage people from migrating to big cities. For example, Surat in Gujarat is a small town developed in this manner, today it is one of the top 10 industrial areas in India.  In conclusion, I believe that the problem of building housing for the increasing population can be tackled by expanding existing cities and constructing new towns. In either case, it is important for the government to ensure that adequate facilities are in place before cities are expanded or built. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is a very popular practice in the modern society to order ready-made food from restaurants, rather than cooking at home. The main reasons for such a tendency may be cheap prices in some restaurants and people’s desire to save some time . Even though ordering food  some obvious advantages, its disadvantages should not be underestimated.On the one hand, ordering prepared food may be the best choice for a busy person, who does not have time for cooking and cleaning. Cooking food at home requires a considerable amount of time, moreover the cleaning process may take even more time and resources than cooking itself. For example, cooking a simple dish such as chicken with rice  home requires significant amounts of water and electricity for electrical appliances such as the oven and dishwasher. Hence, having an opportunity to order food from a restaurant will save a lot of time, electricity and water.On the other hand, delegating the process of cooking to some restaurant  a dramatic disadvantage of not having the information about the ingredients used in the meals. With high demand, grow the volumes of required products, which sometimes can affect the quality of purchased produce. For example, it is a very common practice in some restaurants to make salads from products that are about to go bad and mask the rotten scent by adding some chemicals and spices. Hence, some restaurants may use poor quality products or chemicals for boosting taste and preservatives, which may have a negative effect on the customer’s health in the long run.In conclusion, ordering food from restaurants may be a tempting choice for people who have no time for cooking at home, but this approach has a critical disadvantage of being not informed about the ingredients used in the meal, which can have destructive consequences.",8,False,74.75,299

"While some people think that learning history is crucial for understanding the present, others argue that it is a waste of time. This essay supports the idea that people can improve their future by studying past, and it disagrees with people who believe that historical situations are unlikely to be repeated in future. People who are in support of studying history opine that it provides opportunities to learn from the mistakes. Every nation faced challenges in the past and sometimes wrong decisions taken in those situations resulted in undesirable outcomes. People can learn from these mistakes and take better decisions in case they face similar circumstances again. This essay agrees with this notion, because it can be easily observed that almost every developed country gives significant importance to history, which shows that a willingness to learn from the past mistakes helps in achieving economic and social milestones. However, many people argue that the historical situations are not comparable / can never be compared to the current scenarios. These people think that world has changed in so many different ways that learning about the history is useless. This essay does not agree with this thinking because history has repeated itself many times. For instance, Pakistan and India suffered huge losses when they fought their first war against each other; however, both countries did not learn from their mistakes, and consequently they were forced to fight several subsequent battles. In conclusion, nations can control their present and shape their future by learning from the mistakes committed in the history. Although dynamics of the world have changed significantly over the period of time, history tends to repeat itself; therefore, it is always useful to study the past and to anticipate similar situations.

"Criminal tendencies have nothing to do with age. It is observed that the number of juveniles committing serious crimes is on the rise. Some people opine that teenagers committing heinous crimes should receive the same punishment as adults. I fully agree with this view. When teen offenders are treated like adults and given the same punishment, it will be a lesson for other teens contemplating crime.  First of all, the age of the offender is irrelevant in the case of grave crimes like murder or rape. Many teenage criminals these days are not afraid of the consequences of their act since most states currently protect them under the Child Protection Law and give them only light punishments. For example they are asked to do community service for 6 months or put in rehabilitation centres for just about a year for misdeeds likes robbery. Juveniles committing major offences are also treated rather leniently. Unfortunately, this sends the wrong message and encourages more teens to commit crime. Therefore it is paramount to give severe punishments to teen offenders so that neither they nor their peers will want to commit crimes again.  Secondly, if a child is old enough to commit a heinous crime, he should definitely be considered old enough to be punished as well. This is vital to reduce the number of repeat crimes committed by these individuals. According to a survey by the Harvard University, countries that award severe punishments for all criminals regardless of their age had a significantly lower juvenile crime rate than the countries that protect children from receiving adult punishments. This is the reason why it is crucial to treat teen offenders just like adults. In conclusion, the problem of growing juvenile crime can only be tackled by awarding them punishments in accordance with the gravity of the offence that they committed.

"It is true that acquiring new language skills is by no means an easy task. Language learners might encounter several challenges such as unfamiliar accents or grammar structures  a foreign language. However, in my opinion, such difficulties can be tackled by a well-rounded education system.When it comes to languages, it is undeniably crucial to get used to a native accent and intonation for effective communication. However, picking up an accurate accent can be enormously difficult, especially for adult learners because of their lack of language learning ability. If a language learner has an unrecognisable accent and intonation, they would not be understood by native speakers. On top of that, each language has different grammar and typical grammatical sequencing of words. For example, Korean sentences always end with verbs whilst English  not, which means that a Korean English-learner should  the correct order of words.Despite the aforementioned difficulties, I strongly believe that everyone can master a foreign language when a couple of feasible steps are taken. Firstly, it is more important than anything to start learning a new language at a young age. By incorporating foreign language programmes in the primary school curriculum, children can easily be exposed to languages of the world and eventually acquire language skills without difficulties. Secondly, the government can financially subsidise schools to run student exchange programmes that help adolescents to get experiences abroad and make friends overseas while improving their foreign language in a  way.In conclusion, I believe that individuals can have difficulties in learning a new language because of different accents and unfamiliar grammar, however, these problems can be overcome by a good quality of education system subsidised by governments.",8,False,98.430474069633,275

Some people opine that this emphasis on negativity has an adverse impact on people and the society. I agree with this view to some extent. Negative news cannot be ignored. It certainly deserves media attention; meanwhile good news should also get adequate coverage.  Media houses give too much importance to stories of crime, violence and other problems because they have a shock value. They easily capture the attention of the reader or the viewer. Since media is constantly striving to attract more eyeballs, they highlight these stories. Unfortunately, when people hear only about bad things happening around them, they develop a pessimistic attitude towards life.

This is bad because the world really is not such a bad place. On the other hand, media cannot overlook bad news. Media is the voice of the public and as such it is their duty to highlight the problems plaguing the society. Only then will the authorities wake up and do something to resolve the issues. Also, by reporting crimes and other negative stories, media can urge people to take adequate safety precautions. Meanwhile, positive news should get adequate attention. It is important for newspapers and televisions channels to highlight stories of courage, fortitude, ambition, perseverance and achievements.

"In today’s world, children are obsessed with electronic gizmos. Experts have argued that it is essential for youngsters to play outdoor activities rather than staying at home and playing computer games. I am fully in favour of this idea and in this essay I will support my view with valid arguments and examples. The main reason why I support the thesis is that it helps them to have better physical health. Nowadays, most of the youngsters are overweight and this is because they do not participate in sports which require physical activities. Playing sports such as basketball and football can help juveniles to get rid of fatigue that creeps into their day during the course of the day; thus, it keeps them mentally and psychologically healthy. Moreover, playing outdoor sports enhances their blood circulation and increases their metabolism. By contrast, if teenagers stay indoors for longer hours, they will not burn the extra calories they have gained from eating fast food; hence, they will be overweight. In addition to this, taking part in outdoor sports can enhance their social skills. Children can brush up their communication skills, problem solving skills, and leadership skills when they play outdoor sports. Playing cricket, for example, not only makes the youngster physically fit, but also teaches them how to communicate with their team mates, how to cope with a difficult situation and how to take informed decisions. The argument goes that if juveniles are kept busy playing with their Play Stations, they will lack independent decision making skills throughout their life. In conclusion, I reiterate that I fully support this argument that youngsters should engage in outdoor activities as it will assist them to have better health. In addition to this, it develops certain invaluable social skills in them. Nevertheless, it is important to strike a balance between studies and outdoor activities so that their academic performance does not suffer.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

While there are many students who study at home using technology, some people believe that it is not as beneficial as physically attending a university. I completely agree with this view because attending college has a direct influence on the overall development and intellect of a student.  There are several advantages to studying in a college or a university. One of them is the atmosphere which persuades the youngsters to study. As such, there are fewer distractions in such an environment unlike home where children, relatives and neighbours are sources of disturbance. Moreover, in a college the student has the opportunity to learn the subject practically. For instance, many universities conduct hands on classes to provide in depth knowledge of the topic. This is impossible while studying through the TV and the internet. Also, teachers can assess the students’ learning process and their progress on a daily basis by means of tests and this is not exactly possible in distance learning. Thus, the real purpose of education is attained when a student physically attends a university.  Additionally, life at a university can shape a student’s character. At the university, the students have the opportunity to meet people coming from different countries, cultures, family and financial backgrounds. This interaction will help in moulding the student’s personality unlike virtual learning which impedes such development. Furthermore, the youngsters are likely to skip classes when they are virtual but the rules and regulations imposed by the university forces the young scholars to attend the class regularly making them more disciplined. Thus, attending a college will help in moulding the personality of the students.

"It is an irrefutable fact that advertisements are ubiquitous. Most of the well-established organizations throughout the globe take the help of adverts in order to enhance their sales. Advertising can be made more impactful by adopting different strategies, which are discussed below. Having said that, I believe that it has deleterious impacts on the community. To begin with, advertisements can be made more impressive by following these approaches. The chief one is that these should be creative and entertaining, because people tend to like new ideas and watch entertaining ads. Another persuasive method is to hire famous celebrities to promote products. This is mainly because these prominent people are adored by millions of followers who try to imitate their lifestyle; as a result, their fans will most likely buy the products endorsed by their role models. However, advertisements affect society in a negative way. To elaborate, although it makes residents aware of the newly launched items, it promotes the use and throw culture. As a result, individuals are spending their life savings recklessly to buy unnecessary items. Apart from this, commercials mainly target children as / because they are more impressionable than adults. After watching these ads, kids force their parents to buy those useless products. Since many families are not well-off, this compulsive urge to own the latest products can land them in the debt trap. Hence it can be said that advertisements are detrimental for the society. In essence, from the aforementioned arguments it is evident that though multinational companies increase their revenue by making intriguing adverts, in the long run, ads have negative effects which are hazardous to the society.

"Nowadays, more and more professionals from underdeveloped or developing countries are choosing to live and work in richer countries. This migration will lead to problems such as skills shortage and economic stagnation in their native country. Increasing the salary scale and offering better living standards to skilled professionals are the only ways to retain talent.  One of the major problems caused by such brain-drain is shortage of skilled professionals which makes it difficult for poor countries to achieve economic development and improve the living standards of their poor people. Due to lack of skilled professionals such as doctors and teachers, the citizens of these countries struggle to get basic facilities such as medical and education. For instance, a recent survey conducted by WHO (World Health Organization) revealed that the mortality rate is high in underdeveloped countries due to shortage of skilled doctors. In addition to this, because of such migration of professionals, poor countries depend on foreign technical aid which costs them billions of dollars and further aggravates their economic instability issues. To illustrate, in 2011 the economy of Venezuela almost collapsed due to their huge spending to get foreign technical aid. In other words, migration of skilled professionals from underdeveloped or developing country creates problems such as skills shortage and economic instability in their countries. However, there are various solutions to these problems such as offering better pay scale and better living conditions. One of the reasons professionals leave their county is to get better salaries and benefits. So the government can offer better salaries along with incentives to skilled professionals to entice them to live and work in their country. Another possible solution is to improve the standard of living, as every professional looks for better standard of living. The government of these countries can spend their budget to improve the standard of living of its citizens by borrowing funds from external banks. For example, underdeveloped countries like Bangladesh took long term loan from World Bank in 2010 to improve their education and medical facility. In short, better pay scale and good standard of living are the best possible solutions to be undertaken by developing/underdeveloped countries to stop the migration of skilled people. In conclusion, skilled professionals are leaving their underdeveloped native countries because they do not have adequate opportunities there. Unfortunately, this migration hurts the development of their motherland and to stop this, the governments should launch special schemes and employment opportunities for the educated and aspiring youth.

"The number of highly skilled professionals leaving their developing countries for better life and careers in the developed countries is rapidly increasing. Leaving a country for a good life and work opportunities is certainly their choice; however, because of this migration development of their country suffers. However, it is possible for governments of such developing and under developed countries to make a good environment for such professionals and discourage them from leaving.  The biggest issue arising due to such migration from poorer countries is the lack of skilled professionals in different professions. For instance, from India many doctors and engineers migrate to North American countries. Now, because of this a country with 1.3 billion population does not have enough experienced doctors and skilled engineers to cater to the needs of the medical and the industrial sectors. Moreover, the governments of developing countries spend a lot of money for the education of their countrymen and when they migrate for their better future, they deprive the country of the benefits which were expected from them.  While these problems seem to have no solutions, governments can make sure that expected benefits can be availed from these professionals before they migrate to other countries. For example, governments can ask them to sign a bond which requires them to serve their country for a certain number of years before they leave. In addition, governments need to make sure they develop a certain level of environment by developing the infrastructure, improving communities and reducing taxes. By taking these measures the governments can provide an environment similar to that in developed countries and discourage professionals from wanting to migrate.  To sum up, migration of skilled professionals affects the developing and under developed countries economically and reduces the development pace of different sectors; however, by providing better opportunities within the country, the governments can address this issue to a great extent.

"No doubt celebrations have an important impact on our lives. As competition amongst the workforce is intensifying, individuals are finding their lives to have become more stressful. Moreover, they work overtime, usually unpaid, just to stand out in a more than ever competitive job market. Thus, people would need a gateway for them to vent all this stress. More often, many stressed workers find this gateway during celebrations and parties. Perhaps it gives them a chance to remember the good things in life, such as love and companionship, away from the hectic work environment. However, many people find spending money in celebrations to be a waste of time and money. In fact, they see such an act as an obstruction for one to do great things. In their opinion, such an enormous amount of money, which are spent on food and accessories for parties, could be spent on less trivial things such as education. As far as I am concerned, I believe that celebrations are essential in our lives. However, everything should be done in moderation. After all, controlling expenses is important too. To sum up, Celebrations is an important element in our lives as it relieves stress we face on a daily basis. Never the less, we must keep in mind that expenses should be controlled and that there are other important aspects of life such as career development.",7,False,76.66666666666667,230
"Time is changing and so are the favourite pastimes of youngsters. Nowadays, many adults can be seen spending time doing shopping. The ever changing fashion trends and the desire to show off in front of friends are the main causes of this change. In my opinion, this is a negative development because of the wastage of money, time and energy. Every day a new fashion trend or a new gadget is introduced in the market. The young adults want to update their wardrobe according to the latest market trends. For example, whenever a new movie is launched, girls try to imitate the style of the actress by buying clothes similar to what she wore in the movie. Moreover, many times adults want to show-off their status in front of their friends. They want to splurge money in order to do this. That is why we see many youngsters with large friend circles hopping from shop to shop and spending money. This is a negative development because of the wastage of money. The youngsters spend their hard-earned money on unimportant things. They buy all the stuff which are useless and collect all the junk in their closets. Furthermore, it is a wastage of precious time and energy. The time which could be spent in a more productive way is spent on buying things which are not needed. Instead, they can join gymnastics or aerobics to have a healthy mind and body. Thus it is evident that mindless shopping / excessive shopping is a waste of money, time and energy. To conclude, more and more youngsters now spend their time shopping because they want to follow the latest fashion trends and to impress their friends. However, it is a negative development as it is a complete waste of time, energy and more importantly money. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"More and more people are migrating to cities in search of better job opportunities and lifestyle. The expansion of cities, unfortunately, causes many problems. Traffic congestion is one of them. Some people argue that building better transport networks is the most effective way to solve this problem. Others insist that the government should build more roads to make way for the growing number of private vehicles. In my opinion, both measures are required to tackle the traffic problems plaguing large cities. Improving public transport is unarguably the most effective way to make cities more livable. When buses and trains run on time and provide connectivity all over the city, few people will want to drive their own vehicles. This will automatically reduce the number of private vehicles on the road. When there are fewer cars on the road, there will be no traffic jams. Another advantage of having fewer vehicles on the road is that air quality will automatically improve. Respiratory problems caused by air pollution affect almost everyone living in the cities and a reliable public transport system will help everyone breathe easily. Building more roads and improving existing infrastructure is also important. More roads enhance connectivity and in most cases they also reduce the distance between two parts of the city and thus reduce travelling time. Another advantage of building more roads is that it will reduce road mishaps and save many lives. In conclusion, improving the frequency and reliability of public transport is definitely one way of resolving traffic issues affecting metropolises. Building more roads is another measure worth considering.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate. ",9,False,69.60540691314019,283
"Although it is sometimes thought by many people that a foreign language is only used when they travel or work in a different country, other people have a contrasting view as they think that there are much more benefits to learning a second language. In my opinion, a person can gain a lot if they know how to communicate in a foreign language. On the other hand, some people think that they should learn a foreign language only if they decide / choose to live in a foreign country. Of course, knowledge of a foreign language is beneficial in such situations because this enables the visitor / migrant to communicate more effectively when they are abroad. For instance, someone travelling to China for work from a non-Chinese speaking state must know how to interact with locals and co-workers. Furthermore, knowing their language will make them feel comfortable at a stranger place. However, in my opinion, the reasons for learning a non-native language should not be limited to work or travel purposes as a lot more can be achieved by mastering a foreign language.  Firstly, knowing a second / foreign language will enable someone to understand the diverse culture and the traditional aspects of the country where it is the mother tongue. For example, the language is considered as a gateway to a nation’s culture and traditions. Secondly, many studies have shown that children who can speak a second or third language have far better cognitive development than children who can speak only one language. Finally, knowing a different language can also enable people to read more books or content available over the internet and socialise with people without travelling to that country. To conclude, people may have different opinions, but I believe that the benefits of learning a foreign language are not limited to work or travel. Acquisition of a foreign language helps with brain development. It also opens the door to a culture and civilization. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Band 8 IELTS essay sample Some individuals are of the opinion that the art of growing food and cooking must be included in school curriculum. In my opinion, learning food farming and cooking can prove to be a positive step in children’s development. This essay elaborates on how farming can help children understand the value of food and how cooking it can bring a sense of independence in them. To embark upon, when children are involved in farming, they will realize that a great deal of effort is required to bring food to the table and hence they will value it more. That is to say, to grow a crop, kids will have to sow the seeds, water them daily and take care of the plants in all the possible ways. While performing these tasks, they will understand that to grow a single fruit or vegetable a lot of manpower and time is required and so, it will help them to value food, become better eaters and resist the urge to waste it. To illustrate, in a recent research conducted by the Times of India, it was found that children in rural areas are better eaters than the children who are brought up in urban areas. This is because in villages, children remain close to the farmlands and thus watch food grow from seeds and this makes them emotionally attached to it. Furthermore, the art of cooking helps children become more self-reliant. Cooking the food they have farmed will give them a sense of independence that they can perform their work independently and survive in tough situations. Such self reliance will give an overall boost to their personality and they may start doing their other chores, such as washing or cleaning, themselves as well. Moreover, self-confident and independent kids prove to be a boon for the parents as well, as it lessens their overall burden. In conclusion, children must learn the art of farming as it brings them closer to each meal and helps them understand its value. Also learning the art of cooking enables them to be self reliant individuals capable of taking care of themselves.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is an irrefutable fact that educating children is of utmost importance in this age of tough competition. However, a few people hold the opinion that more money should be spent on educating adults who are unable to read and write. I partially agree with the given statement. I will explain my view in this essay. On the one hand, a country’s progress depends on the education level of the children. If more children are educated in a country that means there will be more engineers, teachers, doctors and scientists.  All these professionals will help to increase the economy of the country. So, we need to make sure that more children acquire education to secure the future of the nation. On the other hand, adults who cannot read and write constitute a considerable proportion of our population. If money is not spent on educating them, they will not be able to earn a livelihood in this competitive world. As a result, many of them will eventually turn to crime leading to an increase in the crime rate. Therefore, it is essential that we take urgent measures and invest funds to educate these adults so that they are able to find respectable jobs for themselves. Eventually, they will be able to support the progress of the nation instead of becoming a liability.

"Many companies now allow fathers to take a few days or weeks off from work after the birth of their child. In my opinion, this is a meaningful idea. In the following paragraphs I will explain why I think so. Just like the mother, the father may also experience a lot of stress and tension in the days prior to and immediately after the birth of their child. The paternity leave makes it easy for them to cope with this situation. If the husband is working at office when his wife is in labour, he is going to experience a great deal of stress. As a result, his concentration on his work will reduce affecting quality. His inability to support his wife during the delivery of their baby is another cause of stress. Because of this reason, in many countries now fathers are also allowed days off from work after the birth of their baby. This short leave entitlement will not only enable the fathers to be with wives during the delivery but also provide work-life balance so that the quality of work is not compromised. The second reason for allowing paternity leave is that husbands can help their wives to take care of the baby. Childbirth can be excruciatingly painful for the woman and she desperately needs someone to help her in the days immediately after the delivery. A husband can be of immense help to a woman if he is around her and her baby in the days immediately after delivery.",8,False,63.25,253
"Many healthcare specialists advise people to exercise caution and be more aware of their health aspects. It is also suggested that a major share of the health budget should be diverted towards health education and preventative steps. I completely agree with this viewpoint. Firstly, I feel that channeling healthcare budget extensively towards pre-emptive health measures will reduce overall medical costs. It will also indirectly contribute to the country’s economic growth. The spending on medicines, lab tests, doctor’s fees, and surgeries is huge. In fact, it surges exponentially if the disease goes undetected and worsens at a later stage. Much of the clinical expenditure can be easily obviated if more money is spent on preventative steps. This can enable every individual to be educated about health. More health campaigns can encourage people to take simple steps of hygiene such as avoiding contaminated needles and refraining from unwanted physical contacts. Due to this, many dreadful diseases such as AIDS, Hepatitis, and Tuberculosis can be prevented. This, in turn, can save exorbitant expenses at a later stage. Secondly, incentivizing health programs can motivate people to support the government in eradicating preventable diseases. For example, a street play or a free seminar can be arranged to enlighten the public about the ill effects of smoking, chewing tobacco, alcoholism, and ignoring health check-ups. Lastly, the precautionary approach towards health will ultimately lead to a better quality of life. Healthy citizens will engender more happiness and wealth in the nation. In a developing country, many patients will be relieved of the extravagant medical costs and their productivity will increase.  In conclusion, I feel both the individual and the country can save huge amounts of money by diverting a major chunk of the health budget towards measures to prevent diseases. It can also provide additional perks to health professionals. Overall, it will raise the bar in terms of adopting a healthy and prosperous living. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"An increasingly digital world indeed has advantages as well as certain disadvantages / downsides associated with it. These are widely visible in our culture and traditions. I partly disagree with the statement that technology and culture cannot thrive together. I believe that although some customs and values are lost, technology has helped in making some other traditions stronger. Firstly, technology has ignited the power of traditional values and have made them more prevalent. To illustrate, there is a website in India called Shaadi.com that facilitates traditional Indian way of arranged marriages of eligible couples. Another example is of the Indian tourism websites, which acquaint foreigners with India’s rich culture and diversity to lure them to visit the country. Through these examples, it is safe to say that because of technology, traditional cultures are now far reaching, thriving and have impactful presence. Thus, traditions and technology can succeed in tandem. Consequently, due to a surge in the adoption of technology, some of the traditional values are being lost. One example of it is the plummeting family values amongst youth. They prefer to spend more time online than physically with their families. For instance, in a survey by Times of India, 50% of Indian youth living in urban areas spend more than 6 hours a day online, which means little family and study time. Undoubtedly, family values have been weakened by technology. To conclude, technological advancements come with opportunity cost. It benefits a society by making certain traditions and customs more powerful and prevalent. On the other hand, it takes away some of our old societal values.",8,False,69.15763041480564,262
"There are some people who often consider that investing in arts is an unwanted move taken by the government. However, in their opinion, spending money on essential services is crucial. In my opinion, spending on arts sector is also essential. Firstly, spending some money on arts should never be considered as a waste of resources. People should realise that arts sector has a major role in showcasing a nation’s tradition, culture and uniqueness of the native people or community. Visual arts and literary arts depict the talents of our poets, writers, linguists and painters. Theatrical performance by musicians, drama actors, dancers and filmmakers is recognised globally and is recommended for most respectable awards. For instance, in India the musician A. R. Rahman won / has won an Oscar award, for his work in the movie named “Slumdog millionaire”. Since the Oscar award is the most prestigious award, it was the proudest moment for every Indian when it was conferred on an Indian. I would say the government should take steps to discover the young talents and bring them to the limelight. Secondly, investing in the arts sector could really help in improving the revenue of tourism. The art galleries, paintings and literary work exhibitions attract many tourists thereby making the country a hotspot for global tourism. For example, Kurukshetra in India is a famous tourist attraction. This became popular among foreign tourists because of the legendary description about the war that took place there many decades ago in a famous literary epic “Mahabharath”. Thus, these literary and visual arts contribute majorly in tourism revenue. To summarise, I appreciate that the government focuses on essential public sectors for the people’s welfare. But I would say that the government should allocate enough funds for the arts sector as well to prevent it from perishing.",7,False,59.461672870715034,301
"In many countries, traditional exams are commonly used to grade students at the end of every semester. These formal examinations are carried out in order to assess students’ academic skills and grade them accordingly. Nevertheless, there are other methods that can be undertaken / there are other grading criteria that can be undertaken by schools to assess their students. For example, they can ask them to write a paper or give a presentation. It is important for the schools to gain information on a student’s academic level in order to determine the grades and promote them to the higher class. In other words, written exams ask students to answer the questions which allow schools to evaluate the student’s knowledge and grade them accordingly. For instance, schools would like to know whether they can promote their students to the higher class and whether they have to improve their teaching methods to adapt to the level of the students. It is for these reasons that formal examinations are still used in schools and universities today. However, formal examination is not the only way to measure the student’s performance. There are several other informal methods as well. Instead of writing exams, students can be made to perform technical writing or prepare the presentation. Students may even perform group discussions throughout the semester. For example, many universities in Germany focus on the practical knowledge and hence assign a small project to write a technical paper and present findings in the class. Even though these methods are not formal, students get the chance to gain practical experience which is much needed for future endeavors. In conclusion, the traditional examination is still a common practice all around the world, and it helps to monitor the progress of the students in order to promote them to the next class. In spite of the ubiquity of formal assessment, there are other much more varied and sometimes creative ways to examine students. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"How to better organize your essays? Watch our videos to find out.  Indeed, with the exponential penetration of internet in the society, online shopping has been gaining popularity among consumers. This development has discouraged customers from visiting brick and mortar stores for shopping. In my perspective, online shopping has made buyer’s life more convenient.  There are numerous advantages to electronic shopping. First and foremost, nowadays customers can buy whatever they need and whenever they need in just a single click. In the contemporary world, every individual is bound by umpteen professional and personal commitments and taking out time from hectic schedule is exceedingly intricated. For those buyers, internet shopping emerged as a boon. Now they can shop at their personal convenience. Moreover, internet shopping is not restricted to any region, state or country and therefore it benefits the customer by giving them a plethora of opportunities to choose their favourite local and global brands. In India, for example, buyers can now buy niche brands like D&G and Versace from their international online stores. Hence, it is evident that internet shopping has many fruitful merits for shoppers. On the down side, there are some disadvantages to this development as it may lead to unemployment. The drastic drop in footfalls in the retail store has been pushing business into loss. To sustain the cut throat competition with online sellers, employers are downsizing, which, in turn increases the unemployment in the society. Also, when people buy online they cannot feel or touch the product. Consequently, it is possible for them to be misled by the images on online shopping sites.  In conclusion, although online shopping may increase the unemployment rate, in my opinion, its benefits like convenience and the opportunity to buy from international brands outweigh the disadvantages.",8,False,107.80500836479254,295
"People have different opinions about the importance of learning history. Some of them feel it is completely a waste of time, while others think that it is absolutely necessary to know about the past events that took place in our world. In my opinion, though it takes a lot of time to learn history it gives us not only an insight into our culture and tradition but also a sense of identity. Nowadays, learning history might not look that interesting. It requires us to remember names, dates and facts which have little use in our everyday life. Obviously, it makes more sense to focus on science and technology which are more relevant in today’s world. Furthermore, each historical event has can be seen in different perspectives and interpreted in different ways. This is also discounts the importance of history as a subject for learning. On the contrary, learning history throws light into how our own culture and tradition have evolved over the centuries. Not only does it highlight our culture but it also gives us a sense of belonging that helps to unite us. History also reminds us about some tragic events like holocaust and racial discrimination. It is important for people to remember these events in order to honour the memories of the victims and also to ensure that they never happen again. In conclusion, not all parts of history are of use to people on a day-to-day basis.  However, studying history is important to discover how we reached where we are today.

"It is often thought that consuming nutritious meals / having a balanced diet is the key to a healthy life. I can only partially agree with this opinion because I believe most of the food items nowadays are contaminated with chemicals. Additionally, physical activities have a significant role in keeping our body healthy. In this essay, I will be analysing these points in detail. Firstly, most of the vegetables, meats and fruits that are available in the market are not healthy due to contamination. Pesticides are applied to the vegetables and fruits during their growth process while most of the meat items are preserved with chemicals. Consequently, these toxic substances reach human body causing many diseases. For instance, a recent study conducted among people who take balanced food revealed that their body had traces of dangerous chemicals. By contrast, exercise helps to keep our body fit and free from illness. Even if someone eats healthy and balanced food, small amount of fat is still accumulated in the human body. Adequate amount of calories ought to to be burned to get rid of this fat. Physical activities such as swimming, running and weight lifting are extremely helpful. For example, my father used to have high blood pressure and heart issues due to the accumulation of fat in the arteries. The exercise turned out to be highly helpful because as soon as he started getting involved in physical activities his health problems disappeared. In conclusion, it is imperative that we realize the importance of exercise and regularly engage in physical activities. Depending only on balanced food will not help as food contamination is a reality.",8,False,83.61589883867836,272
"Generation gap is nothing new and it is not uncommon for children to have radically different views from their parents and grandparents on many aspects of life. Most of the times, these differences pertain to areas such as relationships, career and health and sometimes they do cause problems.  To begin with, young people have a rather carefree and casual attitude towards marriage and relationships. They are more self-centred and insist on having their space in a relationship. Unfortunately, this leads to more divorces and broken homes. Old people, on the other hand, consider marriage as a sacred institution. It hurts them when their children get into casual relationships for fun. In many cases, parents also disapprove of their children’s career choices. Every parent wants their children to have a safe and secure source of income. Young people, on the other hand, do not mind taking risks. Many of them want to be their own boss and start up. Unfortunately, parents often discourage the entrepreneurial ambitions of their children because they believe that launching one’s own venture is risky. Young people and their parents also tend to differ on matters concerning health. While the older generation was quite conscious about health, youngsters tend to take it for granted.  While it is quite common and normal for parents and children to have different opinions on many things, sometimes these differences do cause problems. For example, young people who are not serious about relationships are unlikely to have a stable family life and their children are the worst affected by this. Studies have shown that children coming from dysfunctional families are more likely to get into anti-social activities. Needless to say, a stable family is the fundamental unit of a healthy society and it is important for young people to give due importance to their relationships just like their parents do. Young people should also learn something from their parents about the importance of eating well and staying healthy. As for career choices, in my opinion, it is important for parents to trust their children and their vision.  To conclude, it is quite normal for young people and their parents to have different views and opinions on many matters. Sometimes this does cause problems and in such situations, it is better for young people to listen to the sage advice of their parents.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Learning requires a great deal of focus and dedication and since jobs also require the same, some people opine that it is not possible to pursue studies and employment at the same time. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, in this age of e-learning it is perfectly possible for a committed person to study without quitting their job.  To begin with, online classes have made learning possible from anywhere. Actually, people can now learn even during their leisure hours at work. Hence, any employee interested in obtaining higher academic qualifications can enrol in an online course without quitting their job. Almost every university now offers online programs for working persons interested in upgrading their skills.

"Some people argue that the best solution to the traffic and pollution woes in cities is to encourage suburban and rural people to relocate to urban areas. I do not agree with this view because cities are already bulging at the seams. If more people move to the city, it will only worsen the situation.  Encouraging rural and suburban people to relocate to the cities will certainly help to reduce traffic congestion and pollution if the cities can accommodate them. This is because most people living in suburbs have jobs in the city. Consequently, every morning they travel all the way from their home to their office in the city causing traffic jams along the way. Vehicles caught in traffic emit more poisonous gases to the atmosphere and thus increase air pollution. By contrast, if they live in a place near their office in the city, they can reduce their travelling time and distance. This will solve traffic problems. Hence, if the cities have sufficient infrastructure to accommodate all of these people, it is certainly a great solution to traffic and pollution problems. Unfortunately, this is not the case and most cities are starved for space.  A better solution is to encourage more businesses to set up their operations in rural areas. This will create more jobs in those places and thus prevent the migration of rural people into urban areas. When people can find a job close to where they live, they do not have to travel long distances. This will solve traffic problems and the resultant pollution to a great extent. The government should also encourage organizations to offer the work from home option to their employees. Promoting e-commerce is another way to reduce the need for people to travel. In conclusion, since cities are already overcrowded, it is not practical to move rural people to urban areas with the objective of reducing traffic and pollution. A better solution is to reduce the need for people to travel by providing them with job opportunities close to where they live. ",9,False,70.10410062073618,341
"In England and Australia, the jury is not given the previous crime history of the accused. Some lawyers believe that having access to all the previous records of the defendant helps the judges to pronounce accurate verdicts. I completely agree with the statement and shall put forth my arguments in the upcoming paragraphs. It is pivotal for the bench to have past records of the criminal so that they do not make any prejudiced decisions. Previous history of the accused helps in deciding the severity of the punishment. For example, repeat offenders such as serial murderers and rapists should receive stringent punishment whereas someone who commits a crime under the influence of unfavourable circumstances should be treated more leniently.  Moreover, innocent people are also benefited, if the past records are taken into consideration as they will not be misjudged. For example, a girl may commit murder in order to protect herself from being raped. In other words, breaking the law for self-defense or such circumstances should not be compared with committing a crime intentionally. In this case, the clean history of the girl can save her from life imprisonment or from death sentence. Moreover, the previous history gives insight into the criminal’s social background, upbringing, education, character and mental health status. Therefore, the jury can read the subconscious mind of the convicted and take a well-defined, appropriate, conscious decision.  In conclusion, it is evident from the above arguments that the jury must be made aware of the comprehensive past records of the accused to make judgements without flaws.

"Banning cars from city centres is a recent trend and it can be seen in various cities around the world. Certain advantages and disadvantages immediately spring to mind when considering this step that city councils are taking.The advantages are clear. Since cars were introduced, city centres have always been areas where air quality is poor due to the amount of emissions, which in turn affects people’s health. City centres become quieter and safer for people to wander around shopping and enjoying themselves. Access to city centres can still be good, as it is usually only private vehicles that are banned, and buses and taxis can still take people in and out of the city centre areas. Many towns also operate a park and ride scheme, so people can leave their cars in safe car parks in the outskirts of towns and travel with a dedicated bus service to the town centres. It would seem hard to criticise this kind of scheme.There are critics though to the scheme of banning cars in city centres. City centre shop keepers have often been vocal opponents, as they believe that fewer people will come to the city centres and therefore their incomes will be affected. The general public also sometimes object, as people often like to travel in their own private vehicles. In actual fact, banning cars from city centres has in practice not reduced the number of people who travel to city centres to shop. People like shopping and socialising in city centres and they just adapt to the situation. There is no answer to people who want to drive their own cars. They hopefully will just realise that the sacrifice of not driving their own cars is outweighed by the health and lifestyle improvements of a cleaner and quieter city centre.In conclusion, there are far more advantages to banning cars from city centres than allowing them. It is therefore a measure that most city centres should adopt for their citizens.",9,False,57.79418443841665,328
"Nowadays, sending a text message has become more popular than making a phone call.  There are numerous reasons available to justify this statement. In my opinion, there are a lot more advantages than disadvantages to the practice of sending text messages. One good reason for people to send text messages to others is that they are cost efficient. A text message is much cheaper than a voice call. Almost every telecom company is offering free services for messaging applications. Secondly, texting is considered ‘cool’.  For instance, a survey taken by a university reveals that almost 70% of the young generation prefer to use Whatsapp messenger to text their friends rather than using a voice call to speak. According to young people, using a messaging application like Whatsapp or Wechat is trendier than using a voice call application.  As for the advantages, texting is a quick and efficient way to convey information. Also, a text message is much less intrusive than a voice call. It gives the recipient to take their own time to reply whereas when you make a call, you could cause inconvenience to the other person by calling at the wrong time. However, when you leave a text message, the other party is not disturbed and they can decide whether they want to reply or not. Another advantage of texting is that it is very convenient. There are certain environments which are unsuitable for making voice calls. For example, you can’t make a voice call from a highly noisy or very quiet environment.  In conclusion, the practice of sending text messages certainly has a few disadvantages. For example, we may not get an instant reply. Even so, texting has many advantages over voice calling because it is cheaper, less intrusive and more convenient.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is noticeable that consuming fast food on a prolonged basis will develop various diseases. To solve this problem, some countries plan to increase the tax on fast food. This measure, however, is neither efficient nor effective in my opinion. Imposing a higher tax on fast food only has a marginal impact on preventing people from eating too much junk food. For ordinary people, the low price of fast food is not the primary reason for them to choose this kind of food. Most of them prefer fast food instead of healthy food just because they put convenience on a higher priority than health. Therefore, although an increment on tax will result in a higher price, many consumers may still choose fast food. On the other hand, some people choose fast food because they do not have alternatives. Healthy food, such as organic food, usually have a higher price which might not be affordable for those people. Therefore, if the price of fast food goes higher, there will be much fewer choices of foods for them, which will eventually lead them to a harder life. Compared with increasing tax, making healthy food more convenient and more affordable to citizens might be a better solution for government. Exerting an excessive amount of Interference in the market could cause damage to the local economy. The government, therefore, should try to avoid such risky behaviour. Instead, they can encourage the consumption of healthy food. For example, the commercial cultivation of organic foods can be facilitated so that consumers can buy healthy foods with lower price. Additionally, spending the budget on promoting a healthy lifestyle through education and training to consumers is another practical solution for the problem caused by fast food. In conclusion, to cope with the health issue caused by an excessive consumption of fast food, the government should focus on advertising the healthy lifestyle to the citizen, rather than simply charging a higher tax on fast food.",7,False,69.01707733223229,326
"It is sometimes argued that salary should be the most important concern when one decides whether a job is worth pursuing. Although I concede that earning a decent salary is important to one’s well-being, there is no evidence to show that it is the most crucial factor. On the one hand, I admit that people have to take into consideration how much they will be paid when they search for a job. There is indeed a strong correlation between the size of a person’s salary and their level of happiness. Nowadays, with the rising living standards and cost of living, people need to earn a reasonable amount of salary in order to meet their everyday expenses, such as food, transport, rent, clothing and the like. Without a decent income, one would find it hard to survive in the contemporary society. In addition, one’s salary is very often a determinant of one’s social standing. In other words, in the perspective of many people, a person’s success, to a large extent, depends upon the size of their salary.  However, I would argue that there are other factors that are equally essential to people’s sense of well-being, and that the argument that salary is the most important consideration when choosing a job is logically flawed, because such a claim cannot be backed up by evidence. For one thing, one’s working environment matters a lot to one’s psychological and physical wellbeing. Given the fact that most people work 9-to-5 jobs which require them to spend at least one-third of their day at their workplaces, it is crucial for them to have friendly and understanding co-workers and superiors. And for another, other factors such as the skills, knowledge and experience one acquires from the job may also play an important role in one’s overall sense of achievement, which is another form of happiness. This sense of achievement is often associated with optimism which is an enduring perception of well-being, compared with the temporary and brief satisfaction brought about by a sizable salary and the materialistic things that one can afford to buy with that salary.  In conclusion, while money matters a lot, there are other considerations that prove to be equally important. And so far there is no research which shows that a fat salary trumps all other factors in terms of the role they play in making one happy. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"These days, in most families both parents are working. Because of this trend, some people believe that family members such as grandparents are the best people to take care of their children, while others are of the opinion that childcare centres are better. In my opinion, children should be raised by their grandparents because they provide the best care.  There are certainly a few benefits to leaving children at day care centres. The most important among them is the fact that they have trained care providers. However, many centres are crowded and it is not possible for them to give individual attention to each child. Safety is also a concern. There have been many instances in which children were either assaulted or molested by the care providers at these centres. Another disadvantage is that parents may find it difficult to drop off kids at these centres and pick them up on time because of their busy work schedules.  On the other hand, I believe that grandparents are the best people to take care of children because of the natural affection they have for their grandchildren. Also, they have experience in caring for children. For example, my parents are taking adequate care of my son and I have no concerns regarding his safety.  Another reason for leaving children under the care of grandparents is that it will help them bond better and this will eventually build a stronger and happier family. In addition, when family members look after the kids, parents do not have to worry about taking them to the crèche.  In conclusion, despite the fact that some people may vary in their opinion, I strongly believe that grandparents are the right people to take care of children in the absence of their family. Unlike care providers at a day care centre, they have strong affection for their grandchildren and provide them the best care.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In my perspective, while some experiments with possibly unexpected high-risk should be controlled / regulated by governments, others with controllable hazards can be carried out by private firms.  Multifarious points throw lights on my standpoints. First and foremost, scientific research is categorized / can be categorized into different kinds. Governments should be vigilant) and pay much attention to those which may lead to catastrophic consequences once an error occurred. To be specific, research related to biological weapons or nuclear technology will definitely jeopardize public health if an incident like leakage occurs; hence, such research should only be conducted by the government.For another, since the profit is the only thing that private enterprises chase, something that compromises security is more likely to take place, threatening society. Under the surveillance and control of government, such likelihood will be dramatically reduced.   On the other hand, autonomy should be reasonably given to private enterprises when it comes to regular and low-risk researches. The intention of research is to prove the hypothesis and eventually transfer the outcome into an innovative and practical one benefiting human beings. Without the debate of safety, legislation and morality, innovation always follows the principle—”The faster, the better. This not only caters to the need of this society but also leads to intense competition between companies in the same field.  Empirical evidence has proved that in some field, excessive intervention of governments will only lead to inefficiency, dragging the procedure. Furthermore, the scientific researches are relatively costly; therefore, they will impose overwhelming pressure on fiscal expenditure if governments take control of all of them. To encapsulate, governmental monitoring is definitely an irreplaceable element in scientific research, but we should give some space to private companies whose importance can’t be substituted.",8,False,113.94774772355684,287
"There is no doubt that the world is rapidly changing and one of the biggest changes to it is digital disruption. Over the last few years technology has impacted our entertainment options too. Many people enjoy watching movies on their smart phones and tablets while others still entertain themselves by going to a theatre. In this essay, I will discuss both sides with examples followed by a conclusion. One of the main reasons to watch films on phones or tablets is the convenience. Everyone has got smart phones these days so they can literally watch movies from any location. For example, I travel in train and my journey to downtown takes three quarters of an hour, so I keep myself entertained by watching a movie on my iPad. Moreover, websites like Netflix offer monthly subscription plans at very reasonable prices. In addition, these plans include TV series, documentaries and over thousand films to watch and still they do not cost more than a couple of coffees from Starbucks. On the other side, most people are busy with their work and they need a break from daily routine, so going out to watch a film is the best option for them to entertain themselves. This also gives them an opportunity to catch up with friends and more importantly to socialize with other people. This helps to retain healthy relationships with friends and family too. In a nutshell, there is no doubt that digital entertainment is getting popular, but I personally believe that we should go out occasionally to watch movies with friends and take a break from our hectic schedule.

"Nowadays there is an imbalance in the proportion of television shows on men’s sport and women’s sport. Significantly more time is dedicated to showing men’s sports than women’s sport. In this essay, I will speculate the reasons behind the phenomenon and argue that television should allocate equal time to show both male and female sports. Allocating more screen time for men’s sport than women’s sport can be explained by gender stereotype. When people think of sports, words such as strength, muscularity and agility will come up in their minds and those words are typically associated with men. Consequently, some people still hold the belief that some sports are limited to men and are not suitable for women. For example, Chinese people insist that women should be gentle, modest and tender and should not be involved in brutal sports such as hockey and football. When fewer women participate in various sports, there are fewer events to show on TV. I believe that television should allocate the same amount of time to show both genders’ sports) Firstly, this will help in overcoming gender stereotype. When exposed to more women’s sports, people will gradually change their perceptions that women are always weaker than men and realize that they are capable of playing sports as well as men. It helps to promote an equal stance of men and women. Secondly, it also helps to promote a healthy message to the public. Exposure on television channels is the key to heightening people’s awareness of the health benefits of good health. Since television has a large audience reach, it will motivate more people, particularly women to exercise and thus improve their health.  Uneven distribution of screen time for men’s sport and women’s sport can be attributed to gender stereotype. To break age old beliefs and encourage people to exercise, equal time should be given for showing both genders’ sport activities on television. ",7,False,60.82167138810198,316
"With the tremendous influence of modernisation, remarkable changes have taken place in the family structure to such an extent that nowadays, youngsters are motivated by their parents to live alone as they grow up. However, some people are of the view that it is more practical for a youngster to live with their family.On the one hand, there are many positive aspects to youths living away from their parents at young age. This provides the opportunity to young people to live a life on their own terms and make any decisions without the interference of their parents. Besides, living alone not only makes them independent but also makes them self-reliant, which is a crucial life skill to their successful career. For instance, managing all the house chores such as cleaning, paying bills, cooking and so on will make them well experienced at learning and managing diverse activities and will also boost their confidence.On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that youngsters living away from their family may find themselves in circumstances that may adversely affect their life. Naïve and inexperienced young people in the absence of parental supervision are more likely to fall prey to bad influence and dangerous activities, such as drugs or alcohol consumption, which may jeopardise their career or lead them astray from moral values. However, this situation is less likely to take place with youngsters still living with their parents. Besides, emotional bonding and family relationships can be maintained better if everyone is living together under one roof.In my opinion, although encouraging youngsters to live alone may lead them to learn various life skills, negative aspects and risks associated with living alone can far outweigh the benefits.",8,False,92.23682409308694,284
"Many major cities are facing a housing crisis as they cannot provide enough land for new buildings. Some local governments believe the problem could be solved by reassigning park land for residential development, because this land would be better used for housing. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Band 7 essay sample With the growing population in many countries and the increasing number of people leaving rural areas in search for a better life, the housing crisis is affecting some of the biggest cities. That is because the space is not enough to accommodate everyone anymore. Land currently preserved by national parks may be on their last days as some local governments are willing to reassign these areas for residential development. I strongly believe that park areas should be preserved as long as possible for the sake of quality of life in the cities. Firstly, in this essay I will address the importance of green areas on big metropolises and then a possible solution for this problem. Green areas in large cities play an important role on the quality of the air. The pollution made by cars, factories and the burning of fossil fuels in general is reduced by preservation parks inside the cities. This is extremely important for our health. The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that every city should have a minimum of 9 square meters of green space per person. With the need for space growing without stop on the cities, the local government sees no option besides give up on some of the city’s park lands. A very good way to minimize the negative effects of this action is to create rooftop gardens. If most buildings had large beautiful gardens covering their rooftops, the problem of cities running out of green areas would be solved. In conclusion, I believe that green areas should be protected against the real estate market. The WHO recognizes that a minimum of 9 square meters of green space per person is necessary to live a healthier life in the city. To turn this problem around, gardens should be created on the rooftops of the majority of the buildings.",7,False,70.73299525454351,357
"Some people insist / opine that the school curriculum should give more importance to academic subjects like history or physics, while others argue that the emphasis should be on imparting practical skills. In my opinion, subjects such as science, mathematics and history prepare children for a brighter future and hence they should be given more importance. On the one hand, there is ample evidence to prove that children are interested in practical skills. To begin with, these skills may help them make a little amount of money to fulfil their small needs and wishes. Furthermore, learning practical skills such as cooking, or carpentry is fun because the output can be seen and appreciated almost instantly. For example, in a recent survey done by the sophomores of Florida University, 65% of parents of school going children admitted that their young kids enjoy learning practical skills more than academic subjects. However, learning academic subjects leads to better career prospects in future. On the other hand, during the past decade, job market surveys emphasized the importance of having professional skills. Firstly, scientists and technologists are paid far better than the people doing lower level jobs. In other words, this means that well educated people live more comfortable lives than those who lack it. Secondly, there is a huge demand for professionals in all fields in comparison to the saturated market of blue collar jobs and workers. It goes without saying that if children are encouraged to pursue academic subjects with more interest then they will witness a brighter future. To conclude, practical skills may interest children in their initial stage of life but to have better opportunities and happiness in life they will need to master academic subjects.",8,False,99.22208818862467,283
"The internet has changed the way education is being delivered in the modern society. While some people prefer online mode of education, others still recommend conventional way of teaching in the classroom. Both these approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, the advancement in internet technology has made online learning extremely convenient for students. Nowadays, most of the students possess advanced smartphones which run on 4G technology enabling them to learn from anywhere in the world. They do not need to go to schools or colleges and teachers can deliver their lectures over the internet in real-time and the recorded version of the same is also available for reference. Another benefit of online education is that lessons can be learnt at a pace convenient to students. Individuals have different learning ability and these tutorials provide them a platform to learn at the speed they are comfortable with. Thus, it helps them to grasp the course efficiently. Moreover, online education is less expensive compared to formal method because of stiff competition between companies providing such facility and this favours students. In order to score over their competitor, they provide a hefty discount on courses. On the other hand, when students learn online, they do not get a chance to interact with teachers and their friends as they do in the classroom. This results in turning them into introverts which has a detrimental effect when they start their career in the corporate world. Furthermore, one effective way of learning is group study and online education does not facilitate this. This is available in conventional way of teaching which makes students outgoing and confident while working in a team. Also, it is difficult for teachers to conduct examination in the online mode. As a result, student’s progress cannot be tracked as it is done in classroom teaching. In conclusion, online medium of education is convenient, cost-effective and promotes self-paced learning. However, it lacks in providing an opportunity to build confidence by interaction and discussion.",8,False,81.54762971298402,335
"Most of us have become fashion conscious these days and prefer to wear trendy outfits. In my opinion, this change in our dressing sense/style is a positive development. In this essay, I will discuss how this change is inevitable and how the fashion industry has become an emerging source of employment. It is a well-known fact that change is the law of nature and wardrobes are not an exception to this. Though attire is the historical identity of a community and it is important to conserve that heritage has changed everything. For example, women were bound to veil their faces in ancient India but this is not the case in the modern times. We have working women in the reputed multinational organizations in the contemporary world and we can’t expect them to wear those traditional apparels to work / office. The objective of the clothes was to cover human body and protect it from external environmental factors like dust or cold etc. But now this scope has widened and people have started realizing that there is an appropriate dress code for every event. Because of this variety in dressing style, a whole new industry has developed providing plenty of opportunities for talented craftsmen and designers. For example, the garment and the textile industry is among the largest job providers in India. In conclusion, there is no downside to people wearing stylish garments. This is required to cope with the continuous changes in the society. Furthermore, the garment industry provides livelihood to millions of people. Considering the above, it is quite evident that this is a positive revolution.",8,False,72.28844526641524,266
"While some people believe that creative and independent candidates should be preferred by employers, others argue that they should hire people who are team players and can follow the guidelines. This essay will discuss both the above-mentioned views and will also prove why the nature of the task involved should determine who the right candidate is. Hiring candidates who are innovative and can work independently leads to the optimum utilization of resources. These types of people do not depend on others for help and motivation. They are self-sufficient to perform the given task. For example, they can build a website or an app without the help of his/her co-workers. So, the employer can make the best use of their skills. However, some people feel that candidates who are good team-players and can follow the instructions will give more benefits to the organisation. According to them, working as a team brings the scope of different inputs and collective decision-making. Brain-storming on different ideas results in the selection of the best and improved idea. This discussion is generally done under some unified instructions which help employees to be on one track. For example, creating an advertisement theme requires a team with different inputs of ideas, discussions and collective effort working under the guidelines given by the client. So, people who can perform well in a team and can follow guidelines are advantageous for employers. In my opinion, the type of candidate to be recruited depends on the nature of the work. If the work is more technical and does not require brain-storming on many ideas then it is best to hire people who are innovative and self-sufficient. On the other hand, team players and instruction followers are required for the task which requires the influx of different ideas, discussions and collective efforts. For instance, designing a costume can be done by one person whereas designing an airport requires a big team.  In conclusion, this essay discussed both the contrasting views regarding the consideration of an independent candidate or a team player and it agreed that for maximum utilisation of resources and quality work delivery, employers should hire candidates based on the work requirements.

"The importance of public libraries is undeniable. While some people argue that libraries should be more focused on stocking printed books and materials than investing in digital resources, in this essay, I would argue why availability of digital media is crucial in libraries used by general public. First of all, the last few decades have seen dramatic growth in the use of digital media such as electronic books, learning software and other audio-visual learning and reading materials. This is because these resources are not only easy to carry but also convenient to use in many innovative ways. For example, there are many free websites on the Internet which provide free video lectures for better understanding of a topic. If there are only hard bound books in the stacks and they do not provide these resources, they will become unattractive to general public. As a result, the significance of libraries itself may become questionable. More importantly, modern generation is time poor and they want to access everything quickly including knowledge, which printed books may not always be capable of providing. This is because the growing competition and advanced life style demand more skills and knowledge in a very short time.   For instance, youngster might prefer to listen to the summary of a book converted to the form of a video rather than reading full text. Moreover, important part of digital resources may be emailed to personal devices with the permission of the library, and the same may be accessed later anywhere. To conclude, although printed books will never lose their importance, the young generation is moving towards digital information and learning. In my opinion, I would prefer to access digital and attractive video content in a public library instead of going through lengthy printed text. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Many people prefer watching movies on their smart devices rather than going to the theatre; however, there are still many others who insist that a movie should be watched at the cinema for a better experience. In my opinion, the movie experience offered by the small screen is different from that is offered by the big screen. However, both are viable ways to enjoy a movie. On the one hand, convenience is the most important factor for people who prefer to watch movies on their smart phones or tablets. On a smart device, anyone can watch any movie of their choice at a time and place convenient to them. For instance, anyone stuck in traffic for long hours can kill boredom by watching movies on their phone. These smart technologies also provide the option of skipping entire scenes that the viewer finds boring. Additionally, it is economical for a viewer to watch movies on tablets and smart phones. Streaming services such as Netflix and Hotstar offer movie subscriptions at very affordable prices. They have movies that cater to any taste. On the other hand, watching a movie at the theatre has its advantages, such as advanced sound effects and a wider viewing screen. For instance, action movies are more enjoyable when watched at a theatre due to better sound quality. Furthermore, many 3-D movies are designed for only cinemas and they cannot be watched at home or on any other devices. For example, movies such as Avatar and Captain Marvel are enjoyed the most when watched on a big screen. There is yet another reason to watch movies at the cinema. It is an opportunity for families to go out and spend some quality time together.  In conclusion, the size of the screen does not really matter and a movie can be enjoyed on a small screen as well as at the cinema. It all depends on the preferences of the viewer.

"It is true that global tourism has become a prevalent phenomenon. Some people argue that this industry impinges on their nations. I believe that the negative attitude towards it is because of vandalism and environmental issues. However, in order to deal with this attitude, governments should introduce regulations and policies to manage international tourism.  The main reason why local people do not support international tourism is that numerous foreign tourists do not show their respect to local cultures. It is evident that various local heritage sites need to be renovated due to the damage caused by travellers. For example, a variety of indigenous caves in Taiwan were vandalised by people from overseas. In addition, the local environment can be severely polluted when the number of tourists increases, contributing to air or soil pollution. This is because they throw rubbish into surroundings irresponsibly.  However, my strongly held belief is that these problems can be solved by imposing restrictions on international tourism. Firstly, fining people who commit vandalism is necessary as it can deter them from breaking the law. If tourists need to pay a large amount of fine for their behaviour, it is highly likely that they will avoid committing crimes. Additionally, the policy of limiting the number of tourists should be introduced to mitigate pollution. If a nation only accepts 1000 foreigners to apply for the tourist VISA monthly, environmental pollution certainly can be alleviated. Once these problems are dealt with, local people will change their attitudes to global tourism.  In conclusion, although many residents are against international tourism due to vandalism and pollution resulting from tourist activity, governments can change this attitude by enacting laws that limit the damage caused by tourists.

"Today parents encourage young people to go on educational tours in foreign countries. The advantage of this trend is that it allows students to acquire international exposure and gain confidence. The primary disadvantage is that such trips are expensive and also they expose children to security threats.  The primary advantage of sending students on tours abroad is that they can obtain international exposure and learn about diverse cultures as well as life-style across the world. Consequently, this experience widens their horizons and thus helps them think wisely and make decisions in their life. Another important benefit of foreign educational trips is that students learn to be independent and gain confidence. A confident and well-educated young generation will help build a successful nation.  The main disadvantage associated with overseas school trips of children is the lack of protection to children in some countries. In other words, children may not be able to handle the issues in a foreign land. For example, racism is a problem faced by Indian students in Australia. In addition to this, huge money involved in travel including flight tickets, food and accommodation is another disadvantage of this trend. This puts the burden on parents to spend more money than they can afford on their children’s education.  In conclusion, the trend of sending children to foreign nations for educational trips has merits and demerits. It broadens children’s horizons and turns them into confident future citizens.

"Many individuals opine that one should seek advice from elderly people while others do not agree with this notion. I strongly advocate the former idea. This essay will discuss both of the viewpoints along with some suitable examples in the forthcoming paragraphs. Let us discuss the advantages of considering the opinion of old people. The first and the foremost point is that elderly people have more life experiences than younger ones. As a result they can provide an opinion based on their past experiences. Moreover, their eyes can be more judgmental than ours. There are chances that they may have tackled the same situation, in which we are today, in their past.  Additionally, seniors have better analytical skills. They are also more patient and rationale. This enables them to make unbiased judgments.  Let us throw some light on the second opinion. It is rightly said that every coin has two sides. Elderly people are more conservative / old fashioned. They do not understand the fine aspects of the advanced era. Moreover, sometimes they may not want to lose their traditional thinking. As a result they give some irrelevant opinion. For instance, when we ask our grandmothers to suggest a nice dress for a party, they usually fail to think according to the contemporary fashion and suggest something which is out dated. In a nutshell, it would be apt to say that old people can give the best advice in all aspects of life except certain fields such as fashion and technology. Otherwise they have excellent life experiences which always help them to give efficient advice.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"An examination is the primary way to gauge the ability of a student in modern day society and primary and secondary schools are highly reliant on this approach. While exams help to build competitive spirit in the students and assess themselves, it can sometimes be stressful, which can lead to different health-related issues. Students can develop a sense of competition by writing exams. When a test is conducted, results are given at the end and these results help them understand their position in the class. If they are in the bottom half, they tend to improve to achieve higher marks. As per the study, surprise tests in primary schools are proven to be the best method to motivate children to perform better in the annual examination. Besides, it helps students prepare for life outside of school. As a society today is full of competition, these methods can help them face life with more confidence. However, this approach may create pressure on the brain and depression among students. If slow learners are not able to score well in the test, then it will pressurize them to perform well, causing stress on their brain activity. Moreover, this method of evaluation may lead to a depression state. For instance, a student in Delhi, who scored fewer marks in 10 board exam tried to commit suicide due to constant pressure from his parents to score high grades, which he was not able to. Also, sometimes this method of evaluation may be unfair. A student may be good in expressing his thought on paper and others may not be the same.  To conclude, although it helps us prepare for life and improve our fighting spirit, there several adverse effects such as health hazards associated with it.

"There is no doubt that many people rely more on the Internet for the latest news or trends. Although its utilization has disadvantages such as the threat to privacy, I believe they are outweighed by its advantages and I will support this argument with valid examples. To begin with, some opine that posting private information on the Internet websites may bring security problems. This is because once the individual shares their current location online, their enemies / opponents can plan strategies to hurt/harm them. To illustrate, in recent times the number of attacks on women have increased because their movements can be easily monitored through social media. If an individual is not posting any secure information online, such attacks can be lowered. Thus, many people oppose the extensive use of social networks to protect their privacy and security. On the other hand, I agree with the argument that many people nowadays are utilizing social media as a common platform to connect with each other. The reason for this is that with the help of renowned websites like Facebook, Twitter and Linked-in, people can connect to friends and family living in different parts of the world and also make new connections. For example, multiple job requirements are posted online; people who are subscribed to such information can utilize this information. There are also many newspapers that post the same information but print media takes more time than online media to reach the public. Hence, new generation is making an advantage of fast and reliable media. To conclude, there are both advantages and disadvantages associated with Internet usage. In my view the benefits such as faster connectivity and access to information outweigh the demerits.",7,False,89.43983152827917,281
"Generally speaking, sufficient hours of sleep is required for mental and physical wellbeing. However, studies reveal that nowadays most people sleep less than in the past. This essay explores probable causes of sleep deprivation and its side effects. With time, it is natural to have many changes in the dynamics of life, and some of them are responsible for lack of sleep. Firstly, in this competitive world corporations have extended the work hours. In other words, people have to work overtime. At the same time, they have family responsibilities to fulfill after work. For instance, they may have to help their children with their homework or do other odd jobs around the house and this leaves little time for sleep. Secondly, some people have the unhealthy habit of using social media till late night. Last but not least, television broadcasts a wide range of entertainment shows which are eagerly watched by their fans till midnight. There are numerous negative effects to having less sleep. First and foremost, it reduces concentration and affects productivity. Unarguably, there is insurmountable pressure to meet deadlines at workplace, and hence anxiety, stress and strain augments due to compromised sleep. Secondly, the person may lose his temper as mental relaxation is not achieved in first place. Many times, personal relationships are affected because of confrontation regarding minor issues. To exemplify, divorce cases are on the rise because of disturbed mental state caused by sleep deprivation. In a nutshell, to live a healthy life sufficient amount of sleep is imperative; otherwise, it may lead to many negative consequences as mentioned.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"These days, it is common for journalists and photographers to follow celebrities around to capture their private moments. Most of the time, these people are trying to shoot famous people in embarrassing or compromising situations. These photos are then sold to media houses for a huge sum and within seconds they get plastered all over the media both online and offline. In my opinion, this practice cannot be permitted. Celebrities have a private life just like everyone else and it is important for the media and the general public to respect it. Just because someone is famous, it does not mean that they should live every moment of their life in full public glare. Celebrities have their own private life. They have moments where they want to shut the world out. If photographers follow them round the clock, it can hurt their emotional health. It is tiring to try to behave perfectly all the time. Nobody can accomplish that feat. Celebrities are no exceptions. They have their moments of weakness and those are not to be celebrated on the internet or television channels at their expense. Of course, there are people who believe that the invasion of privacy is the price of stardom. I do not quite agree with this view. It is true that common folks have a lot of interest in the private lives of famous people. Very often, this need stems from their feelings of insecurity and inadequacy. For example, the general public has so much interest in learning about the unflattering side of celebrities. Knowing that famous people also have shortcomings makes them feel good about themselves. However, media persons are not supposed to stalk the rich and famous with the sole objective of digging out juicy personal details. Such details might entertain their readers or viewers, but they do a great deal of damage to the person of their attention. Princess Diana, for example, was killed in a car crash while trying to flee paparazzi. She was with her boyfriend and probably did not want cameramen to capture them together. Unfortunately, the relentless paparazzi chased them leading to the crash that killed the eminent woman whom the world admired. One can never justify such incidents with the lame excuse that it is the price of stardom. In conclusion, like everyone else, celebrities are also entitled to their privacy and any violation of it must not be permitted.",9,False,90.75163421663035,402
"No doubt, people’s health is influenced by the environment and housing conditions. That is why some people opine that governments should focus more on environment and housing to prevent various ailments. While I do admit that these areas require attention, in my opinion, by simply addressing environmental pollution and housing scarcity, we cannot see much of an improvement in public health. Indeed, environmental pollution and dirty surroundings cause many health problems. For example, air pollution is a major issue in cities and consequently many urban residents suffer from respiratory ailments. Lack of access to clean water is another problem that millions of people face in poor countries. Unhygienic surroundings are the breeding grounds of mosquitoes and fleas which spread many diseases. Therefore, if the government looks into environmental pollution and provides basic housing amenities, such problems can be avoided to a great extent. Nevertheless, simply focusing on the environment and housing will not prevent all diseases. The government has to do much more. It has to allocate a portion of its budget to prevent diseases through vaccinations. It should also spend on screening tests through which serious diseases such as cancer can be detected long before actual symptoms occur. In earlier stages most cancers are totally curable through inexpensive treatments. Launching health awareness campaigns is another thing governments can do to improve public health. Even if the government provides housing to all, diseases can still spread if people are ignorant and allow stagnant water to collect in their surroundings.  In conclusion, although giving priority to environmental issues and housing will improve public health, a lot more has to be done to eradicate diseases. The government, for example, has to launch health awareness campaigns, provide free vaccinations and regular health checkups to ensure that people live a healthy and long life.

"Work ethic is a value that has to be instilled in a child’s moral code so that he may embrace the ways of success. However, it is imperative for us that we distinguish between a mere summer job and child labor. Thus, I ought to establish the definition of both. As far as I think, when a child works a full time job so as to provide himself and his family, this is regarded as child labor. As for a summer job, it can be defined as a job with very limited working hours. In this case, a child retains all his rights such as education and welfare. In many countries, children, as young as ten, are encouraged to work for at least the period of the summer vacations. Parents believe that in order to prepare their children for the real world, it would be best for them to gain exposure to the real world through a job. As far as a mere summer job is concerned, it offers a child an invaluable lesson in taking responsibilities and respect for authority. Such an opportunity maybe considered as a mere practical lesson, but it may have the potential to reveal child’s capabilities and skills. Hence, it can help a child’s guardians to discover his hidden talents. In conclusion, a summer job can be extremely beneficial for a child; however, guardians must be careful not to cross the line that separates a summer job and child labor.",8,False,58.28629032258064,245
"It is crucial for children to understand the difference between positive and negative activities from childhood itself. While some opine that punishment is the best deterrent to negative behaviour, I personally believe that it leads to depression in children and should be avoided. Other methods such as counselling and reward based programs are better at reforming the the behaviour of any teen. Undeniably, children make mistakes in their life because they are exploring the world. So, it is the responsibility of the parents to guide their children on the right path and prevent them from any wrong activity. In many countries, punishment has been serving as a method for many years to teach a child. However, punishment distances children from their parents because they may become afraid of them and start to treat them as enemies. With no proper dialogue with their parents, it is highly probable that children will not share their emotions and it may result in depression or other serious mental health issues. Apart from punishment, there are numerous ways to teach a child. To start with, counselling has been proven to be an effective tool for helping teenagers to understand the difference between positive and negative activities. Moreover, proper counselling teaches them about the effect of wrong activities on their future and thus they learn to avoid them. Additionally, reward based disciplinary activities are a positive way to teach a child. In this program, a reward is given to the child after he completes a certain activity. A prime example of this is Sweden, which has implemented this program in their schools and the results were promising. In conclusion, it may appear that punishment is the only method to teach a child about wrong and right; however counselling and reward based programs are more successful because they prevent children from developing depression.",8,False,70.7437047257675,306
"Pictures generally capture the true essence of an event. It is quite common to find news stories these days on television and newspapers along with their pictorial depiction and it has been found to create an engrossing effect on the reader’s or viewer’s mind. This is definitely a more effective way of reporting. Advancements in technology have made almost everyone possesses a smartphone with a camera and thus it has become easier for journalists to capture and report news  / a news story. Any news accompanied by a picture or video has a more riveting effect on people as it has been proven many times that when text or audio is accompanied by visuals, it attracts the attention of people more easily than when it is used alone.  In some cases such as in the case of natural calamities or wars, pictures are crucial for conveying the gravity of situation and the extent of the damage caused. Before the publication of such images, people remained ignorant about this existential threat and tried to shrug off any warning as mere assumptions. Concurrently, the importance of words cannot be completely ignored. A well-written column or a good orator can engage the interest of people without the need of pictures but then again these become necessary to prevent the news from becoming monotonous. Also, it is natural to forget what one listens to or reads but the photographs stay in the memory of people for a longer period of time. To conclude, words accompanied by their visual representation are a much more effective means of news reporting as people need more substantial evidences these days to believe a news story; hence I firmly reiterate that pictures should be added to news being broadcasted or published to create a lasting impression.

"Language proficiency is considered as one of the key factors in the academic growth of children. In the school curriculum, English is considered as the most important language. It is feared that due to the growing popularity of English many regional languages face the risk of extinction. I do admit that this is a possibility. English seems to be indispensable in today’s world. It helps a great deal in getting admission in desirable foreign universities and coveted job opportunities. English dialect is the most preferred for doing business globally. Most of the countries that have high-quality infrastructure and standardized living conditions are the English-speaking ones. Nevertheless, I believe that local languages should also be given importance as it is vital to preserve regional ethnicity, traditions, and knowledge. Elimination of indigenous languages endangers native arts, literature, history, and some music compositions. For example, the famous poems or songs compiled in a provincial vernacular cannot be translated into English without compromising on its originality and essence. Furthermore, a child who lacks proficiency in the local language / who does not speak the local language may miss out on certain positive teachings of his community. Moreover, I feel that studying English along with one or two local languages may be more beneficial. Scientific studies have proven that bilingual people have much better cognitive skills than monolingual people. It enhances their grasping power and decision-making skills. My suggestion is to ensure that the local language is made a mandatory subject in the school curriculum all over the world. Of course, English should be taught and there is no harm in giving it slightly more importance, but the local language must not be neglected. Parents can also play an important role in the conservation of native languages by using it to converse with their children.  In conclusion, I feel that prime importance should definitely be given to the English language. However, there must also be a provision to include the local language of a particular region in the curriculum. This approach will save native languages, strengthen children’s language skills and also help in preserving age old teachings. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to some people, museums and art galleries should exhibit artwork that reflects regional culture instead of foreign culture. I completely oppose this viewpoint because I believe that museums and art galleries serve as the best place for people of a nation to learn about the culture of another country, and they also contribute to the nation’s economy. To begin with, people already have several opportunities to learn a lot about their country’s tradition and history from their elders at home or teachers at school. Therefore, they do not like to visit museum or art gallery that displays artwork of culture already known to them. However, they show a keen interest to gain knowledge of the culture of other countries that they cannot afford to visit and do not already have knowledge of. Thus, they like to visit only those museums which display the artwork of other countries. In addition to this, when museums and art galleries display the history of a foreign country, they can make a financial contribution to a country’s economy. When museums display only native artwork, people do not like to shell out extra bucks to purchase the entry ticket because they feel they are not going to learn anything new. On the contrary, when people feel that they have an opportunity to grasp knowledge about the history of other countries, they are not reluctant to pay for the tickets. Therefore, museums that possess foreign artefacts can contribute to the economy of a nation. In conclusion, I strongly believe that museums and art galleries should not limit themselves to local artwork; rather they should showcase foreign sculpture and artwork as this practice helps people to learn about the culture of other countries without leaving their country.

"Wearing uniform in the workplace is mandatory for the employees of a few organisations. This trend of uniform has both the merits and demerits; however, I believe that this is overall a positive development. The obligation to wear uniform everyday can reduce the productivity of an employee. This means, some workers do not want to wear the uniform that their companies require them to wear as the uniform might not suit their body shape. Therefore they might feel uneasy at work which in turn can hamper their performance at work. Additionally, seeing everyone in the same color or dress everyday can make a company’s working atmosphere dull and boring. People may not feel energetic in such a monotonous space which can certainly affect the overall efficiency of an establishment. However, these drawbacks associated with the wearing of uniform can be reduced to a great extent by allowing the employees to choose the uniform they want to wear.  On the other hand, one of many advantages of wearing uniform is that it can save the money and time of employees. This is because they do not need to waste their time while choosing a different dress for their workplaces everyday and also they can save a huge amount of money by not purchasing too many items of clothing. Moreover, a uniform can promote the brand name and it can make the company widely known amongst the general public. The increased brand recognition will certainly boost the sales and revenue.  In conclusion, although wearing the same uniform can be boring for employees, I believe that the time and cost savings associated with the uniform and the brand recognition it brings outweigh the drawbacks.

"Living in the rural area is  the best option for children by a group of people, while others believe that cities offer more opportunities. In my opinion, if the city offers security and green areas, I agree it is a better place to raise the next generation  some advantages  both sides.Firstly, the countryside  in touch with nature, taking care of animals and helping with the gardening. Because of that, they learn how to protect the environment and to live without any technological equipment. Besides that, they have more freedom to play outside the house without any security worries, whereas in the city they are kept at home  smartphones and computers for this reason.

As a result, all children’s talents and passions can be easier to develop. On the other hand, security, pollution and  contact with nature are issues that we have to worry about.

"Sample EssaySome people argue that town planners should have a preference for more parks and gyms to be created than business districts and shopping malls. While I understand the concerns of people who hold this opinion, it seems to me that shopping centers are just as important as parks and gyms in a town.There are reasons why public facilities are crucial to city inhabitants. First of all, they provide suitable spaces and equipment for people to exercise. For example, people can go jogging in the park and play tennis or basketball at the sports stadium. That helps to keep their bodies fit and it also elevates their mood during the day. Besides, parks and sports facilities are good spots for people to socialize with their neighbors. People can connect with others when they are playing sports or talking casually with passers by in the park. A harmonious relationship between residents helps build a caring and friendly neighborhood.Although parks and gyms give the town dwellers all kinds of benefits, I would like to point out the importance of shopping malls to the district. Firstly, a shopping center could make shopping more convenient for the local residents. It would enable them to easily purchase things in town and transport them home with less effort and at lower cost. They would not need to spend extra money on transportation or shipping of the goods. Secondly, a shopping mall can provide employment. Locals can find work in retail, maintenance or security of the mall, hence earning an income to support their families.In conclusion, although parks and sports facilities serve as places for exercise and social activities for city dwellers, I believe that shopping centers are equally important, since they can provide job opportunities and convenience to the town residents.",8,False,105.32975958414556,295
"According to some people, blue collar and white collars jobs should receive the same remuneration. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, educated people should be paid more than manual labourers. The Jobs performed by both the classes are very different from each other. Jobs that involve manual work are the kind of jobs that require little or no qualification. As a result, the amount of wages paid for these jobs is very low. Jobs like those of construction workers or miners do not require any special skills; hence, they are usually performed by people who lack formal / educational qualifications.   Certain jobs require high level of knowledge and skills which can only be found in highly qualified people.  For example, jobs like those of a software engineer or data analyst requires specific knowledge about computer software and technical development due to which money that they get paid is relatively very high when compared to to the wages of a manual worker. If a manual worker and a qualified individual end up earning the same amount of money, then the value of education will decline. People invest a lot of money in education hoping that one day they will have a promising career with a high pay package and if they see that the people with no qualification are also getting paid the same then they will lose interest in education. Education is the foundation of a country’s development and lack of qualified workforce will eventually effect the country’s development. In conclusion, the amount of pay should not be the same for manual workforce and highly qualified persons. Pay package should be based on the level of education and the experience of the individual.

"Generally speaking, the lifestyle of children has improved considerably over the years. Today they enjoy many comforts and amenities that their parents had not even heard of in their childhood. The main causes of this change are the advances made in the field of technology and the growing income of families. The number of households with disposable income is steadily increasing. As a result, the vast majority of children living in the developed and developing countries today have enough to eat. They can go to school, wear nice clothes and live in comfortable houses with amenities such as heating and cooling. The main advantage of this change is that it has made kids’ lives more comfortable. Unfortunately, at the same time, it has made children unhealthy. Today they eat more junk food than healthy food and rarely flex their muscle. While the previous generation used to play outside in their leisure time, today young people stay glued to their smart screens whenever they get an opportunity. Unfortunately, this sedentary lifestyle has led to various lifestyle diseases among children. While diseases like heart trouble and diabetes only affected the elderly in the past, now they are common even among young children.  Technology has also brought considerable amount of comfort to children’s lives. Most children now go to school in a car or on a bus. They rarely walk even for short distances. In their spare time they watch TV or play computer games. While these activities can help them beat stress, studies have shown that prolonged exposure to the television or the computer hurts the attention span of children. In addition, juveniles who spend long hours on the computer tend to have lower grades and fewer real friends. They become introverts and sometimes even socially aloof. Little wonder that instances of psychological disorders like depression are rising among youngsters.

"There are so many persons in our life and we have different relations with different people. While some people regard friends to be highly crucial, I would argue that family members play a more significant role in our life. Family is the biggest strength of any person. Firstly, family members especially parents are more involved in individuals’ upbringing. From one’s primary school to tertiary education, parents set a role model, spend time to accompany them and educate them to be a useful member of the society. In addition, our parents and grandparents love and nurture us since the day we were born. It is them who provide us with various forms of life necessities including shelter, clothes and food. Without their support we are less likely to survive let alone receive education, the cost of which is also covered by them; however, we cannot receive such kinds of help from our friends. Admittedly, after attending schools, we all tend to socialize with our friends / peers who are more understanding than family members because usually they are of the same age as us. A person can share personal problems with friends and get sound advice from them, whereas the suggestions of their family members are not acceptable to them, due to the fact that their adult parents cannot stand in their shoes. Nevertheless, this benefit is not significant enough, compared to the aid that their families offer to them.  In conclusion, it is true that friends play a significant role in our life. However, family members are more important, care for growth, give without expecting anything from us and help us overcome life difficulties. ",8,False,82.93698006592372,273
"After industrialization there is no denying the fact that the technology is progressing day by day. Today a great deal of work is performed by machines in every walk of human life. This trend has both advantages and disadvantages that I will discuss in this essay. To commence with, automation has benefitted our lives in numerous ways. Firstly, the efficiency of machines has saved people time and energy. For instance, in factories, the manufacturing of goods and packaging of items are handled by machines. As a result, employees are less subjected to workload. Secondly, the same machine can perform multiple tasks such as printing, scanning and copying and this contributes to time saving. Moreover, household appliances have made it easy to perform daily chores / day to day domestic chores.  Conversely, increased utilization of machines reduces physical activities of an individual. Therefore, reduction in physical stamina is evident nowadays. In fact children, for instance, deal with growth disorders and lethargy due to continuous use of computers and electronic gadgets like laptops, tablets or smart phones in their leisure time rather than playing outdoor games. In addition to that, industrial revolution has increased unemployment rates as human labour is replaced by machines. Moreover, breakdown of machines create a great deal of interruption in work. Thus, total dependency on machine is unreliable. In conclusion, there is no doubt that many tasks are being performed by machines in every sphere and they save energy and time. However, dependency on machines can affect the heath of an individual and cause a decline in the employment ratio of country. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Overpopulation is rising at an alarming rate in major cities around the world. It is caused by the migration of rural people into urban areas because of the lack of educational or employment opportunities in villages and small towns. Building educational institutions and industries in villages is the most viable solution to this problem. To begin with, although there are plenty of schools and colleges in rural cities, there are very few universities. This forces / encourages many aspiring students to migrate to cities in order to pursue their higher education. Another major cause of the rise in urban population is the availability of better job opportunities in cities. As there are considerably more industries in the cities than the countryside, many people opt to move to cities for better career prospects. The government should take several measures to check the migration of rural youth into urban areas. For example, it should build not only schools but also colleges in villages. This move will make higher education easily accessible to rural people and thus mitigate migration.  In addition, the government should encourage industries to set-up their business operations in the rural places. This would foster employment and give rise to job opportunities in the rural places. For example, Gujarat government has taken several measures to establish universities and industries in the district of Anand and this has drastically reduced the population in cities such as Ahmedabad and Baroda. In conclusion, if the government takes necessary steps to build universities and encourage companies to set-up their operations in rural cities, the problem of overpopulation in developed cities can be tackled.

"It is true that some people work hard while others prefer not to push themselves beyond a certain limit. There are various reasons for these different attitudes to work. In my view, passion for one’s work is a desirable quality in an employee, but too much hard work can be counter-productive and unhealthy. There are three main reasons which encourage people to work hard.First, some people work extra shifts to earn more money. They believe that with the extra income earned, they can buy comforts for themselves and for their families. Second, newly employed people work for long hours to reach the targets set by the employer in order to secure their job. They fear that their employer will replace them with more competent people, if they fail to reach the target. Finally, there are people who are very passionate about their career and work. They work mindless of the passing of time or their family commitments to achieve their career goals and earn higher social status. However, people who work hard usually face serious problems at the workplace and at home. To begin with, people doing long shifts are more likely to commit mistakes due to work pressure. As a result, they make huge loss to the company which they work for and lose job. Also, sometimes due to over load of work and odd working hours, people do not give time to their family. Consequently, arguments may arise between partners creating trouble in their relationship. Moreover, many studies have shown that there is an increase in the number of people suffering from stress disorder and other neurological illnesses due to extensive working hours. To conclude, it is evident that hard work allows people to achieve their career goals and earn more money. However, working hard neglecting one’s health and family is never a risk worth taking.",8,False,75.35470085470085,308
"Some people opine that home appliances like washing machines and dishwashers and communication tools like the internet and smart phones make our lives more complicated and elevate our stress levels. I do not agree with this view. While I do admit that overdependence on technology might lead to unexpected situations and increased stress, judicious use of technology will certainly reduce our stress levels by making our lives easier. To begin with, time is the most precious commodity in this world. Generally speaking, any technology that saves time is beneficial for us. Modern innovations like emails and the internet make communication superfast and thus save a lot of time which can be used for more productive things. For example, these days technology has enabled many people to work from home. This allows them to save precious time which would otherwise have been consumed by the daily commute. They can use that time to build better relationships or to cultivate a hobby. Studies have shown that people who have time for themselves and their family tend to have considerably low levels of stress.  In addition to that, the labour saving devices significantly reduce the amount of energy and effort required to perform tasks. Consequently both individuals and businesses are able to get more work done in less time and with less effort. This conserves their energy which they can use for playing a sport or doing some other tasks that they enjoy. For example, if people have sufficiently higher levels of energy even after completing the day’s work, they can perhaps go for walk in the evening or do some gardening. Both activities will refresh their mind and benefit their physical health.  On the flip side, excessive use of technology and overdependence on it can certainly be problematic. For example, these days due to social media addiction most people have an uncontrollable need to stay connected to the internet all the time. If they lose connectivity even for a few minutes, their stress levels peak. The misuse and abuse of technology also lead to many problems. However, these issues can be resolved by using technology only for the intended purpose.       To conclude, even though new-age scientific inventions create dependency and unexpected problems, if they are used moderately and wisely they will definitely reduce our stress levels.  ",9,False,91.43726235741445,384
"At present, the Internet plays a vital role in almost every aspect of human life. As a result, individuals are searching online  reasonable solutions to their illnesses. Not everyone is convinced that access to such information online is safe and helpful. However, in my view, providing the general public with access to trustworthy information about medical disorders would invariably improve the quality of the medical care for the whole society.Nowadays, even though there are plenty of online platforms  developed for medical education, most of the sites have not been written by professional healthcare providers. Hence, there is a high possibility of spreading wrong medical information throughout the world, unless the site developers are held accountable for the content they provide. If patients receive incorrect information about a medical procedure and follow the wrong advice, for instance, to remove a wart at home, it might lead to a serious infection, excessive bleeding or another medical emergency. That would constitute a negative effect of using online knowledge for medical treatments at home rather than visiting a professional.On the flip side,  the Internet, the society is well aware of most common medical disorders and preventive measures. Consequently, a reasonable and prudent individual can decide whether to get professional opinion on one’s disease or to handle it at home,  that they get reliable online medical information. Moreover, if patients can manage mild medical problems themselves, it would certainly reduce the workload at the local hospitals, freeing more doctors for patients in real need. Besides, if patients come with a certain extent of knowledge about their condition to the medical consultation, it would invariably be helpful to the medical practitioner for effective decision making.To sum up, it is evident that online search for information on medical disorders can be a positive development as long as the general public receives trustworthy information.",8,False,93.10653138871274,306
"News and media have become an indispensable part of people lives. I agree with the argument that these are impacting us in a positive way by entertaining us and keeping us informed of the latest events.  Media is the vital source of entertaining stuff which rejuvenates and entertains us throughout the day. Due to the demands of the job and conflicts in families, everybody has a lot of stress in their daily life. Listening to music and watching videos give us a relief from the monotony of work and relaxation from family problems. For instance, I am a software engineer who spends around 2 hours every night to watch a comedy show on television because it energizes me for the next day. Thus it is evident that the media play an important role in improving the productivity of people.  As the world is changing rapidly, it is crucial to keep ourselves updated with the latest developments. News provides us a deep knowledge and understanding of the latest happenings around us. As a result, this makes it very easy for people to react to current events. For example, when India government recently decided to build a road through a national park, the news informed people about the disastrous consequences of the project. A campaign by the people compelled the government to abandon the project. To conclude, in my opinion, the news and media influence people’s lives in a positive way as they entertain us and assist us stay informed and vigilant. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Environmental pollution is a critical concern that requires immediate attention across the globe. According to some people, environmental protection has become a global issue and should be addressed at the international level. I strongly agree with this view as the international communities can easily create awareness in every part of the world and can provide funds to protect the environment. Firstly, environmental issues should be addressed by the government as well as the international organization as these bodies have a platform to reach maximum people and by using that platform they can create awareness about this topic. For instance, international organisations & NGO’s can launch various campaigns and programs to create awareness about environmental degradation. They already have a strong communication network that can educate many people about this serious issue. Therefore, publically known organizations and rich nations can contribute to protecting the environment by educating people and leveraging their financial strength and technical know-how. Secondly, global communities and the government can use some portion of their funds to protect the environment. To illustrate, these organisations can use some funds for planting trees, for establishing bio-gas plants and for manufacturing and promoting eco-friendly transportation. Hence, some of the resources must be allocated every year for finding solutions to environmental damage. After analysing the topic in depth, it is understood that by taking this issue to the higher level, more and more citizens will get awareness about the issue and they will contribute by reducing their carbon footprints. In addition, international bodies can establish numerous eco-friendly solutions at the global as they have sufficient resources to do that. It is hoped that all capable communities will give maximum contribution and support in order to make this earth greener and pollution free.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

Migration of highly skilled workers is a bane for developing or underdeveloped countries. This is mainly because the loss of qualified workforce leads to the stagnation of development in these countries. There are a number of solutions that can be implemented to deal with brain drain from poor countries. Firstly, the main problem associated with brain drain / the migration of skilled workers is that poorer countries need them to grow economically. This is to say there are various areas like healthcare and technology, where these countries need to develop themselves and they fail due to shortage of manpower. To illustrate, Nigeria has an underdeveloped healthcare sector due to shortage of qualified doctors leading to under development in other industries. Secondly, if the rate of brain drain is not tackled poor countries will become poorer while strong economies will take advantage of it. First world nations have already peaked their development. It is poor countries that require more human resources to create wealth for their citizens. There are two effective solutions to deal with this problem. One way to discourage brain drain is through rewarding and recognizing talent. This is because with good pay they can enjoy a good lifestyle similar to what developed countries offer and through recognition they will be widely accoladed for their contributions to society. Another solution is providing these prodigies with a special status in the country. Through this status they will feel that their presence is highly respected and required in their own country than others. One clear example is the recognition given to Indian Army through tax breaks, subsidized housing and government aid for children’s education. To conclude, when the qualified labour moves to other countries it costs a poor nation its economic development and monetary growth. This can be tackled by extensively recognizing their talent with good salaries, awards and granting them special stature.",8,False,94.23576749720127,332
"Thanks to advancements in healthcare, people are now living longer than their parents or grandparents. Longevity is definitely good and desirable but problems may arise when there are too many old people in the society. To start with, the elderly people are not very productive. They cannot work or earn and as a result many of them are dependent on their children or social support programmes. This is not exactly a problem if they have sufficient savings or if their family is able to take care of them. However, this is not always the case. Old parents or grandparents can strain the budget of financially poor families. Many of them have to subsist on social welfare schemes run by the government. Unfortunately, this puts a burden on the public exchequer because in order to provide for the elderly population, the government has to allocate a huge amount of money. As a result, it will not have enough money to spend in other areas. Another problem associated with increasing life spans is the deterioration in the quality of life. Although people are living longer it does not mean that they are living healthy and happy lives. Many senior citizens survive on medications. They need assistance even for performing their day to day activities. This necessitates the constant presence of a care provider in the house. For example, in India it is quite common for the daughter or daughter in law to quit their job to care for their aged parents or in-laws. This can hurt their family finances. Also, sometimes adult children may treat their parents as a burden and refuse to provide them the love and attention they need. As a result, many aged people are forced to live in old age homes.  To conclude, the advancements in medical science have certainly increased the lifespan of people. However, longevity can be a problem for people who lack an adequate support system. Also, an increase in the elderly population can hurt the productivity of a country and force the government to earmark a major proportion of its revenue for their welfare.

"International air fares are falling. More and more employers are offering holiday entitlements. Needless to say, the number of people who travel to exotic holiday destinations across the world is on the rise. While this trend has both upsides and downsides, in my opinion, the advantages outweigh the disadvantages. The tourism industry has witnessed tremendous growth over the last few years. And it looks like it will continue this upward trend. The growth in the tourism sector has many advantages. In many parts of the world tourism has created more jobs than any other industry. Tourism helps countries to earn valuable foreign exchange. Tourism has also helped in the preservation of many heritage structures and art forms which would, otherwise, have died without leaving a trace. For example, many ethnic Indian dance forms would have died if they hadn’t received the patronage of foreign tourists. Tourism also promotes cultural understanding. As people travel to other countries, they get an opportunity to learn about other cultures and beliefs. Intercultural understanding is always good for global harmony.  On the flip side, tourism has some disadvantages too. In many countries, particularly those in the under developed world, tourism has led to the establishment of some morally questionable practices. For example, many tourist hotspots in Asia and Latin America are now synonymous with prostitution and illegal gambling. Tourist hotspots are also plagued by problems like theft, maimed begging and drug abuse. However, these disadvantages are nothing compared to the advantages and it doesn’t take a lot of efforts to see that tourism has more benefits than drawbacks.  To conclude, the growth in the tourism sector does have some downsides; however, the negatives pale in comparison to the positives because tourism creates jobs and promotes understanding between people.

"Thanks to advance in technology, authorities can now keep a constant watch on their citizens. While it is true that the people being watched are often unaware of this happening, in my opinion, the benefits of this practice outweigh the disadvantages.  The public places in majority of the metropolitan cities are kept under round the clock monitoring with the help of security cameras. The constant vigilance on the densely crowded areas, not only limits the chance of any untoward incidents from taking place but also provides security intelligence in case of any suspicious activity happening. The culprits can be brought to book, with the help of available video evidence. The tracking of non-physical activities like internet usage and cellular phone messages is also possible with the help of available technology. A constant watch on the cyber activity provides vital information about any security threats to a particular country and with the help of tracking these activities can be neutralized before taking place. Although the constant information gathered helps in the public safety, at times it can cause severe problems to the individual citizens. Sensitive information like bank records or property details if fallen into the hands of criminals can lead to cyber crimes. With the current day technology, money from one person’s account can be transferred to criminals’ account with this information. The tracking of internet usage can also casue inconvinience to the people. Telemarketing agencies target the people based on the information gathered through the cyber activity of people and call them and make phone calls to them without consent. These calls might happen during important working hours leading to decreased productivity.

"With the advancement of technology, use of computers has increased dramatically. Students in particular have become overly dependent on computers. Although computers make learning easier, they cause problems such as plagiarism or distraction. This essay will discuss the problems associated with over dependence on computers and also suggest some solutions.  The main problem with the use of computers among students is that they easily get distracted from studies. When students study on computers they have easy access to the internet. As a result, they may lose focus and start surfing various websites. Ultimately, this will lead to the loss of precious study time. Consequently, they search for online solutions for their study problems or even outsource their homework by paying a fee. For example, according to a popular survey conducted by Times of India, there was a significant drop in the grades / marks obtained by students after the introduction of computers in the classrooms. However, there are solutions to this problem. One of the solutions to the problems discussed above is to block irrelevant websites from students’ computers. If useless websites are blocked on students’ computers they won’t be distracted and they won’t be able to copy their homework from the Internet. Another possible solution could be the use of plagiarism detection software. When this software is installed, students will not search for solutions online as they know that they will be caught by the software. For example, many universities use plagiarism detection software to check whether assignments submitted by students are genuine or not. In conclusion, there are some problems associated with reliance of students on computers. Students could lose focus on studies or they may copy homework from the internet. However, these problems can be solved by installing plagiarism detection software and by blocking unwanted websites.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to some people, youngsters ought to be motivated to leave their family when they reach a certain age; others disagree. They think that children will benefit more if they stay with their family; however, I agree with the former group. In my opinion, young children will be transformed to independent individuals and they will also have an incredible career growth once they leave home. First, permitting children to stay away from their home will enable them to think and act freely. In other words, this will assist youngsters to develop their decision-making skills. Also, the experiences they gain from the outside world, along with the struggles and challenges of the new environment, will undoubtedly help them in many ways. A recent study by the University of Delhi found that 75% of the youngsters who live independently are good decision makers. It also states that they are successful at differentiating the good and bad aspects of life. Second, children get a plethora of opportunities to explore the world while they are away from their home. When they reach the initial phase of their career, they will be induced with knowledge of different career options available in the job market. Furthermore, this will guide them to choose a career in which they can work energetically and enthusiastically, thus, leading to a satisfying work life. In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinion I strongly reckon that young children should be allowed to leave their home after a certain age.

"Nowadays, many youngsters are getting into romantic relationships but some people argue that this is not a good idea. I completely agree with this because it can create certain issues in their lives. The most preponderant reason why younger people should not get involved in a romantic relationship / love affair is that it can affect their careers. In other words, while they are in a relationship conflicts are bound to happen and they will increase their stress levels. As a result, they would not be able to concentrate on their studies or their jobs. For example, a friend of mine got so disturbed because of the regular fights with his girlfriend that he left the job and moved to his native place, and now he is struggling to find employment there. If he had not left the job, he would have received a promotion. Another reason for not supporting the idea of getting into a relationship at a young age is the risk of unwanted pregnancy. This is because young adults do not care much and mistakes can happen during intimate moments. This can be extremely dangerous. Moreover, if the pregnancy is terminated, it can have detrimental effects on the girl’s health. Also, if they decide to have the baby), it will be a huge financial burden, which can be challenging for some couples. Worse still, they may get ostracised because premarital sex and pregnancy are a taboo in most traditional or orthodox societies. In conclusion, although youngsters like to be in a relationship, I firmly believe that it should be avoided because it can distract them from their career paths and put them under tremendous pressure. There is also the risk of unwanted pregnancies. Do you have an essay on this topic? Post it in the comments below for a free band score estimate.",7,False,83.00738719884396,305
"A particular section of individuals believe that the primary issue associated with the education system of developing nations is the methods of teaching whereas others opine that shortage of teaching resources is the main concern. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss both the perspectives. The way of teaching in developing countries is totally different from that in developed nations. Firstly, poor countries use the traditional method of teaching that comprises of lecturing. In this method, the teacher delivers the lecture to a group of students and the group contains students of various intellectual levels. Hence, certain topics could be difficult for some students to understand. Secondly, the students find this method boring and lose their interest in their studies. To elaborate, sometimes students fall asleep in the class as there is no interaction between the teacher and the students. Lastly, due to low wages the teachers do not want to take any effort to teach the students. On the other hand, lack of teaching resources is also a crucial problem in developing countries. There are numerous sophisticated devices which enhance teaching and learning. However, these are not affordable for the poor countries. Moreover, the internet is an essential component of the modern education but due to its cost some poor countries cannot make it accessible in all the parts of their nation. Apart from this, the government of poor countries is not capable of providing some other amenities such as transportation, libraries and school buildings as they do not have enough money resources. In conclusion, conservative teaching methodology and insufficient resources which pose a negative impact on the education system are the reasons for the low economic status of poor nations.

"Forests are an integral part of the planet earth and they are like lungs of it, as they help the planet to breathe properly. Therefore I am in consummate accord with this statement and in my opinion deforestation will eventually lead to the end of many species on earth. Forests keep ecological balance intact and help the survival of numerous species including human beings. They have an impact on climate and weather conditions. Trees in forests help to purify the air by taking CO2 and releasing oxygen. They provide shelter to several animals during all seasons like hot summer and heavy rainy season. They play a key role in maintaining the temperatures balanced. If the planet has trees in abundance, the change of seasons will occur naturally. On the flip side, deforestation leads to irreparable damage and severe /disastrous consequences. More and more trees are being cut down to accommodate the needs of the growing population. This in turn is impacting the earth in a very undesirable manner. For instance, the increased pace of deforestation accelerates global warming and results in the melting of polar ice. Uncontrolled cutting of trees also leads to air pollution. If trees are cut, the air does not get purified and the polluted air becomes a major health hazard for all living beings. Many animals and birds have already lost their habitats and are facing extinction. As forests are destroyed, the rare herbs and medicines found in them also get destroyed. In conclusion, forests play a key role in the survival of life on the earth and excessive deforestation will wreak havoc and lead to the loss of most of the species and ultimately the end of life on the planet.",8,False,66.08333333333333,286
"In the modern society, traffic and pollution have become a major problem. The government is coming up with various schemes to fight / tackle this menace; however, there is no solution yet. A few people are of the opinion that increasing the tax on petrol may help to improve the situation as this measure will help to reduce the number of vehicles and the resultant air pollution. In my opinion, this move will have more disadvantages than advantages. Petrol plays a very important role when we count the factors that impact the economy. If the price of petrol increases, it will affect the price of other commodities as well. Commodities need to be transported from place to place and when the cost of transportation increases, essential items will become expensive making survival difficult for the common man. Also, when oil prices increase, the public transport will also become costlier. The poor sections of the society will be the worst hit by this measure because the hike in the price of petrol will not deter the rich from driving their own vehicle. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that a drop in traffic will reduce air pollution. Automobiles are just one of the causes of pollution. There are various other factors such as wildfires, the burning of crop residues, and factories. Serious measures need to be taken to control them. To conclude, after discussing the various factors contributing to pollution, it is not hard to say that petrol is not the only reason for all the problems. In my opinion, petrol prices should not be increased as this move will impact not only related sectors but also the entire economy. Worse, it is unlikely to deliver the intended result.

"In many nations, some people feel that it is imperative to fund the construction of high speed railway lines connecting cities whereas the rest of the population opine that the money will be better spent on developing the existing public transport infrastructure. Both schools of thought have their pros and cons.  Firstly, let’s talk about why we need high speed trains connecting cities. Our economies have become more and more dependent on one another and it is important for both goods and people to travel quickly between major metros. The rapid growth of the airline industry has enabled us to play and work on a truly global scale. Airplanes are the most common mode of transport used to travel between cities as it is cheap, fast and very efficient. However, it has brought its own problems like tremendous amount of air pollution which causes health problems and most importantly global warming. This is where the high speed trains come into the picture. They run on electricity, which if generated from renewable sources like solar and hydropower solves the problem of air pollution. These days the locomotives have become very silent and thus they even put breaks on noise pollution. They will also be a lot cheaper to manufacture than planes. They will, however need to be fast enough so that people will prefer them to the aircraft. The French, Japanese and Chinese already have a huge network of high speed rail lines.  Unlike high speed trains, which connect cities, public transport enables citizens to travel within the city. The bustling metros of today have been engulfed by concrete structures and family cars. While personal vehicles have made traveling more comfortable, they have also caused a great deal of pollution. A lot of people have realized this and want to reduce the air pollution and leave behind cleaner cities for their future generations. If the government invests in public transports, more and more people will want to use it.  To conclude, I feel that building railway lines for high speed trains connecting cities and developing public transport will solve two different problems. The former will enable green and efficient travel between cities. On the other hand, the latter will allow people to commute to and from work without causing much of an impact on the environment. Therefore, I am of the opinion that both the ideas are equally important and should be funded accordingly to create a cleaner and sustainable future.",8,False,87.31420497692622,410
"In the era of globalization, tourism has started playing a vital role in the development of economies. Nowadays, tourism makes significant contributions to the economy of a nation;, however it has some drawbacks too. This essay will discuss the pros and cons of tourism before arriving at a conclusion. The two major advantages of tourism are the augmentation of the national economy and the generation of employment for local people. Firstly, tourists use a wide range of services which includes hotel bookings, tourist guides, food and transportation. This results in additional income which in turn contributes to the nation’s economy. For example, tourism increases consumptions of domestic product which have significant impact in the overall GDP growth of the country. Secondly, tourism creates a significant number of job opportunities as without people tour operators, restaurants, hotels and transport services cannot operate. Hence, tourism brings significant benefits such as boost in national economy and employment for local people. However, there are various disadvantages associated with tourism such as destruction of popular destinations and rise in criminal and illegal activities. Firstly, the massive influx of tourists to places like historical monuments and pilgrimage centres causes significant damage to these age old structures. In addition, to cope up with the demand of tourists / tourism national resources are overexploited. Secondly, as tourists carry valuable items with them such as cash, jewelry and other expensive items, they may become the targets of thieves and other anti-social elements. Hence tourism also has many disadvantages which can be eliminated by the government if they ensure proper security measures and timely maintenance of popular tourist spots. To conclude, in spite of the fact that tourism has certain disadvantages such as destructive effects on monuments and increase in criminal activities it has very constructive effect on a nation’s economy and gives a plethora of new job opportunities for locals. I personally believe that the advantages of tourism outweigh its disadvantages. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Whilst some people spare their free time working in order to make progress in their career, others prefer spending it in the company of close relatives and friends. It is argued that spending time with children can have many more benefits than being outside, such as in the office. Both preferences will be discussed in this essay.   In this modern world, people are busy working long hours in order to enjoy a better life. This group of people, who are extremely ambitious, are aware that this path will lead to more freedom and a more comfortable life with less stress in the future. I argue that this is very beneficial and people should pursue their ambitions, but it should be before they have children; otherwise it can have long term negative impacts on their children. For example, a study done in 2006 revealed that successful children with positive attitudes mostly came from the family where parents work fewer hours and spend more time with them.    On the other hand, some people enjoy spending their time surrounded by family and companions. Most of them do not have future goals to accomplish, and they do not complain about the present circumstances. It is argued that these people are much more satisfied with their circumstances, so their level of contentment is on a much higher level. According to Harvard University, 67% of people who live a modest life are less stressful than the successful ones. To conclude, life goals and ambition determine how people will spend their leisure time. Even though working too hard can contribute to the achievement of a better standard of living and more experiences later in life, it should not be prioritized by the family people with children since they should devote adequate amounts of time for raising their children.

"Rising population in urban areas leaves governments with no choice but to build more houses to meet the demand. However, when it comes to construction, there is more than one way to build new homes. Some cities prefer to construct fewer residential towers, while others build a larger number of low-rises for their residents. In this essay both options will be discussed and a viable solution will be suggested.One advantage of tall buildings is that they can accommodate a large number of people while having a small footprint. This type of construction is popular in central city areas where land is scarce and expensive. For example, in New York City high-rise buildings have significantly reduced housing problems, by as much as 55% in the last few years. As a result of this strategy, rents tend to decrease which has a further positive impact on the economies of such cities. However, tall buildings offer little or no privacy, they force certain rules and regulations upon residents, and attract higher maintenance costs.Given a chance to voice their opinion, many individuals would prefer to live in low-rise buildings or even build their own houses. This option might be more attractive for big families and for older generation people who like to have their own personal space. Accessibility is also a concern for the elderly as taking the stairs when the lifts break down may not be an option for them. In addition, one or two-story houses are easier and cheaper to maintain compared to modern apartment towers. The downside of this type of dwellings is that they occupy much more land, and since land is cheaper on city fringes, new estates tend to be built away from city centres. This increases commute time to work for their residents and negatively affects their quality of life.In conclusion, high-rise and low-rise buildings have their unique advantages and disadvantages. In my opinion, high rises are more suitable for younger residents and should be built in the areas where young population is prevalent, closer to the city centre and employment opportunities. Senior citizens should have a supply of lower dwellings available in quieter locations. Such flexible approach can be a good way to address the needs of growing city’s population.",8,False,104.6771549919244,372
"Please note that all band score estimates are approximate. Happiness is the ultimate goal for everyone. It is true that money cannot bring it. This essay will discuss the reasons why happiness is hard to identify and offer ways with which people can obtain happiness. To begin with, there are reasons for the hardship in identifying happiness. First of all, it is a proportional feeling. Different people feel and react to happiness in different ways and different circumstances. Unemployed people might feel happy because of a job offer, businessmen and business women could feel happy if they make transactions. Furthermore, happiness also has some connections with genetics and geographical locations. For instance, in the international happiness index always countries from west Europe and North America score the top spots. So generally speaking it is very hard to define happiness. At the same time, happiness can be obtained in different ways. Firstly, people should always be satisfied with their life. Regardless of financial situations, it is vital for people to be pleased with what they have and what they have achieved because this satisfaction will ultimately bring happiness. For example, a survey conducted in a poor community in Sudan in 2012 and it found out that 90% of interviewees were happy with their lives even though they had financial difficulties. This clearly shows that happiness is achievable even without having a single dollar. In addition, people should try to set goals for themselves to achieve because they will bring hope and eventually happiness. To sum up, it is evident that happiness is difficult to define because of the nature and geographical locations of people. Happiness could be achieved by being satisfied with life and setting goals to achieve. Struggling to get a good score in the IELTS writing module? Get your writing samples corrected by us.

"It is true that some people are comfortably settled in their workspace and refuse to switch organisations. However, there are those who like to experience change. In this essay, I will discuss both of these behaviours and share my own views. There are certainly some benefits to sticking to the same job. To start with, people who stay loyal to a company are more likely to be promoted to higher positions. This is particularly true in sectors that value experience. Also, by working in the same company they can create a comfort zone around them. They are more likely to enjoy a good rapport with their colleagues and even seniors. This insulates them from many work related problems. In addition, loyalty is still valued by most organizations and people who choose to work in the same office are more likely to receive various perks and incentives. Better still, they are the last ones to lose their jobs in case of a recession. On the other hand, there are many more benefits to changing jobs whenever new opportunities present themselves. The biggest benefit is the opportunity to acquire diverse experiences. When a person starts a job, it is not always possible for them to predict whether they will enjoy it or not. If, after working at a company for one or two years, they discover that this is not the right job for them, it is always better to resign and find another job. Another advantage of changing jobs frequently is that it may enable a person to get a raise or a promotion more easily. For example, if they work in the same organization it may take a low level employee several years to get promoted to a mid or high level employee. This is because organizations tend to have a hierarchal system and it is not always possible to skip the steps of the ladder. When they change jobs, however, they may get to occupy a higher position as soon as they start. Of course, this is true only in the case of highly sought after professionals with unique skill sets. Sometimes changing jobs is the only way to get the raise or promotion a person deserves. Not every organization values talent and those who find themselves stuck at a place that does not do justice to them, quitting is the best option. To conclude, working at different places while gathering knowledge and experience is a more sensible and faster approach to reach a high position in your work-specialisation than working at the same place. This is because climbing the hierarchy at one particular place would take many-many years as it is difficult to replace the top position holders. Almost everybody spends the majority of their life time working. We work approximately 40 hours a week for 35 years until retirement. Some workers prefer working at the same company all of their working life while others believe that changing the workplace often is more advantageous. Both views will be discussed in the following paragraphs before arriving at a conclusion. On the one hand, staying in the same organization for long makes employees experts at particular skills and thus helps them grow / climb up the career ladder. For example, a financial officer can become the financial chief executive within 8 years if they work in the same company. A permanent job not only gives chances of getting promoted but also offers several other benefits and hence many people do not want to change their workplace. For instance, when they work in the same environment, employees do not need to change their routine life or travel outside of their city. On the other hand, it is true to say that working for different organizations allows an employee to earn more experience and perspective. This means that the worker can efficiently improve their other skills. Additionally, when any workers apply for a new company, they can request higher salaries. It is one of the opportunities for employees to make progress in their work life. In summary, both long-term and short-term jobs offer various benefits for employees. If they choose it properly at the right time and at right place, they will get the optimal outcome. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is true that these days many people purchase ready-made meals instead of cooking at home. There are many merits to buying cooked food from the market; however, the demerits of this trend cannot be neglected. Firstly, the foremost reason for buying meals rather than cooking is the convenience. Because it takes time to prepare food at home, many people prefer to buy ready to eat meals. Secondly, purchasing food from the market is cheaper than cooking it at home. For instance, these days a number of food ordering mobile applications operate in the market and they offer great deals and discounts on food orders. Thirdly, there are different meal options when someone is buying food from the market. Consequently, there are several benefits to this trend because of which there has been a decline in home cooking in recent years. On the other hand, due to the rise of this trend, the health of individuals is deteriorating. Since people are not eating fresh and healthy foods, they are not getting essential nutrients. As a result, obesity is on the rise which further elevates heart related diseases. A research conducted by Harvard University suggests that in developed countries, junk food is the prominent cause of obesity and heart issues. Therefore, the negative effects of this trend are severe and life threatening.  In conclusion, the ready-made food has become an integral part of a person’s everyday life. However, considering the presented facts, I believe that this practice of buying readymade food certainly brings more harm than good. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Recently, purchasing used clothes has become a popular trend, especially among young people. The main reason for this is that today’s youth is often short of money and, I believe that it is a positive trend as it recycles old clothes and is therefore beneficial for the environment. To begin with, most of the youngsters these days do not have sufficient money to buy a variety of clothes. The reason for this is unemployment, as many young ones do not have a lucrative job to fulfil their desires. Moreover, branded clothes mostly have a high price tag which is generally not affordable to the young generation; thus they prefer to buy the second-hand outfits having cheap rates. To exemplify, owing to the popularity of used clothes among the youngsters, the number of second-hand outfit stores doubled in the year 2019 in Delhi. Thus, this trend provides the opportunity for the youngsters to try multiple varieties of attires in low budget. Choosing second-hand clothes is a form of recycling and, in my perspective, it has a positive impact on the environment. This is because the production of garments and fabrics involves the usage of chemicals, water and electricity in large quantities, which gradually leads to the over-consumption of natural resources and thus affect the environment. To illustrate, according to a survey by the ‘Time’, garment manufacturing industries consume a huge amount of electricity and chemicals. Therefore, with the usage of second-hand clothes, the production of new ones can be minimised to some extent, helping to reduce negative environmental impacts. In conclusion, more young people are choosing to buy second-hand clothes due to shortage of money, and this has a positive impact on the environment by reducing the need to produce and reusing of the old ones.

"While some people insist that parents are responsible for moulding young children into responsible adults, others opine that teachers have a greater responsibility to impart value education. In my opinion, schools have a greater role than parents in shaping the socio-cultural behaviour of children. This essay explains why parents are not the best people to impart social values.  Parents are the first teachers for any child. They are the first people the child comes into contact with and during early childhood, they are the only influence on the child. However, as the child grows up and starts school, they will have a variety of influenced on them at that stage, it is not easy or possible for parents to monitor their conduct strictly. Also now in most families both parents go out to work and it is very difficult for them to give complete attention to the social and moral development of their children.  Schools, on the other hand, teach students values such as discipline, punctuality, empathy and so on. Also schools help mould kids into better grownups by teaching them teamwork, and giving them opportunities to participate in various socio-cultural activities such as tree plantations, clean up drives etc. The other key aspect is that children spend a considerable amount of their day at school with their peers and so it is the most suited place to learn and perfect social values and good conduct. For example, in my secondary school, it was compulsory for everyone to to participate in community welfare programmes. A school alone can provide ample of opportunities for kids to to embrace these intangible values and practice them in their lives. To sum up, parents undoubtedly are the first people who teach children values but the role school plays in nurturing kids with their holistic approach is definitely incredible. Hence, in my opinion, schools have a greater impact than parents on the social and moral development of children. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Thanks to the advancement in the transportation facilities, the scope of tourism has increased immensely. Some countries rely on tourism as a major generator of wealth while there are certain drawbacks such as destruction of local environment; however, in my opinion the advantages outnumber the disadvantages. Some places have unique characterstics like being historical monuments or exotic scenery which attracts people from different parts of the world. The tourists visiting these places spend money there by buying products and services. Locals can also earn money by working as tourist guides. The tourism industry also indirectly boosts the related sectors like travel industry and helps in improvement of infrastructutre. Aslo many times there will be certain entry fee to visit any  historical structure. The income generated by this means will be helpful in preserving those monuments for future generations. On the other hand people living in places where tourism industry is not developped will not be able to benefit from such opportunities.  On the other hand, if the tourist location is not managed properly, it can cause deleterious effect on the ecology of that place. The demand for increased accomodation can lead to the construction of more hotels and often this causes the destruction of forests. This disturbs the balance in the environment and might lead to the extinction of rare flora and fauna. Some famous places which attract tourists are situated in places where the local people have unique language and culture. The locals often have to deal with foreign visitors leading to acculturation which can result in the erosion of indigenous cultures. To conclude, tourism is a vital sector that generates employment opportunities and boosts national economy. However, it is important to address important issues like ecological destruction with proper planning. On balance, I believe the advantages of promoting tourism outweigh the downsides.

"It is often argued that social networking sites especially Facebook are influencing people as well as societies in a negative way. I completely disagree with this statement because it social networks help people to solve many socio-economical problems. There are many reasons I believe that social media plays an important role in an individuals’ life. Firstly, it makes human relationships stronger. To be clear, social networking sites bring people from different parts of the world together. These sites have even helped many people to find their lost families. In addition, social networking sites allow people who have common interests to form groups. For example, Facebook has several community groups created by people with extra ordinary skills in art, music, dance or cookery. Those who are interested in these activities can join these groups and learn new skills. Moreover, it gives relaxation to those who do not have time to meet or communicate with anyone outside. Another important advantage of social networking sites is they help people to act against social issues. To explain it further, users often upload photos of missing persons and other social problems.  For instance, recently, photos of missing kids were posted on the Facebook by their family member. Due to the large influx of likes and shares, the picture became quite famous and authorities had to take quick measures to resolve the case. As a result the culprit was captured and penalised under law. In conclusion, social networking sites have some drawbacks but if they are used properly they have more merits than demerits.",8,False,94.7139709869848,258
"More and more children are becoming obese and developing various health problems as a result. The main causes of childhood obesity are the excessive consumption of fast foods and the sedentary lifestyle. Encouraging physical activity and promoting healthy eating habits are the best ways to tackle this menace.  Fast food joints are mushrooming all over the world. They are a favourite with children because their food is tasty and addictive. Unfortunately, junk food is rich in calories and various preservatives and additives. Regular consumption of these foods causes weight gain in children. Worse still, these days most children lead a sedentary lifestyle. They hardly flex a muscle. Instead, they sit in front of the computers and televisions for hours on end eating loads of chips and cookies. When the physical inactivity is coupled with regular consumption of fatty foods, the result is obesity. Encouraging children to get physically active and limiting their intake of junk food are the only ways to combat obesity. Parents must ensure that their children are eating healthy, home-cooked meals. While there is no harm in eating a burger or a pizza from time to time, children should not be allowed to have these only a regular basis. In addition, parents must encourage their kids to play a physically demanding sport like football or cricket. Playing a sport helps them burn the excess calories in their diet and thus lose weight. It is equally important to limit their screen time. In conclusion, children are becoming obese because they eat too much fatty foods and sit for hours on end without moving a bit. Encouraging physical activity and limiting the intake of fast food are the only ways to tackle this problem.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In schools, students learn to analyse literature, calculate using trigonometry and understand how photosynthesis works, but often students are inexperienced and helpless after graduation when encountering the real world. It is therefore argued that schools should teach their students how to survive financially in the world.This topic is difficult though. Many educators believe that a school is supposed to teach students in subjects that they will most probably not encounter again post-graduation, so that teachers can develop open-minded and well-informed individuals. At the same time, it can be argued that schools should impart skills that would be applicable in everyday life. Mathematics, for example, is supposed to not only communicate actual mathematics skills, but also teach logic to students. However, schools are supposed to prepare the youths for their lives following high school. Currently this goal is not fully met, as often students are unable to handle their finances sensibly and therefore can often face significant problems. Schools that teach students how to survive financially could change this.This significant shift in the ideology of education is unlikely to take place soon, as the education system has been in place for too long to be easily changed. Also a change of this scale would be costly, as teachers would have to be trained and a syllabus for this potential subject would have to be created. However, in some countries, for example Germany, a community subject is available in which politics and finances are discussed. This leaves students from Germany in a better situation to deal with finances in their lives.In conclusion, training school students in financial matters would be very useful. Adding new content to the syllabus would require a significant amount of money, but the entire community would benefit from students being better prepared for adult life.",9,False,59.41286572301641,297
"Art has regained some of its lost glory and governments have started realizing the importance of preserving it. While some people welcome this trend, I completely disagree with this practice as I believe there are several other critical functions for the public administration to focus on. It is widely accepted that the field of arts not only represents the contemporary lifestyle but also helps us to reflect back on the lives of our ancestors. Historical artifacts like sculptures and paintings that are exhibited in various museums attract a lot of visitors and generate some revenue as well. For example, the Kohinoor diamond of Delhi sultanate is a very famous exhibit in the British Royal Museum in U.K. But I believe that the cost of maintaining the museums and the salaries of curators easily exceed this income .Therefore, no official can justify this investment in art as it is not of any benefit to the general public. What’s more, other critical functions of the society like public healthcare continue to be ignored by a lot of countries. Large sections of the community especially the underprivileged are deprived of basic health amenities like vaccines and preventive health checkups. For Instance, the disease of tuberculosis continues to affect thousands of Indians even today. If the government had diverted some of the funds invested in art to these areas, India would have had a stronger young generation. Therefore, I believe that public representatives should start thinking about these vital aspects instead of spending money on the maintenance of art galleries and reviving lost art forms. To conclude, despite the fact that art contributes a lot to the society and tourism in general, I would like to emphasise the fact that governments should invest most of the funds in crucial services like the public healthcare which help in building stronger nations.",8,False,84.61913449609574,306
"Some people believe that it is essential to keep our home and office neat and tidy with everything kept in their right place. I fully agree with this view. This practice not only eliminates unwanted stress from our lives but also brings joy and peace.  Firstly, keeping our surroundings decluttered is a pre-requisite to having easy access to various things we use on a regular basis. By assigning a proper place for different items we can find them without wasting any time unnecessarily. For instance, I have a specific place for keeping my passport and other personal ID cards and I make it a point to put them back each time I use them. This habit comes to my rescue when I have to find these cards urgently for filling up a form or submitting an ID proof. Thus, it saves me from the hassle of searching for my ID cards in every part of my home and trying to recollect where I might have put them after using them the last time.   Secondly, a clean and well-maintained home and workplace bring peace and harmony into our lives. It is a well-known fact that cluttered homes and workplaces irritate people and sap us of our energy. In addition, I have often observed that the act of tidying up and organizing things itself gives us a sense of satisfaction and happiness.  In conclusion, my opinion is that we all should strive to create a clean and organised environment around us. It will not only make our lives easier but also give us more joy and happiness by eliminating stress from it.",9,False,97.45493866489218,270
"Today, in many organizations employees play an important role in decision making. Some people argue that this should be done only by the management, while others argue that employees should be a part of it. I will discuss both points of view and provide my opinion in the conclusion. To begin with, managers have got wide experience and vast knowledge on different processes. If managers are not given importance of their role and responsibilities, then they would feel neglected. For instance, a manager knows how his/her team members can arrive at the best decision. This will be beneficial to stakeholders and employees. Likewise, many confidential documents are taken into consideration while making a decision, so employees should not be involved. On the other hand, employees feel motivated and prefer to stay longer if they are a part of the decision making process. One of the reasons is that employees would be affected if a wrong decision is made, so if they are a part of it they can suggest some changes. For example, employees prefer a transparent environment and will have a better bond with their manager if they are allowed to make decisions. If employees are happy, the attrition rate of an organization will be low. In conclusion, important decision making should be the responsibility of the management. However, if employees are taken into consideration, it will lead to a better work culture and more satisfied employees. Hence, in my opinion workers should be a part of the process along with their managers. This seems to be a band 6.5 essay.",7,False,72.88924928287086,261
"It is argued by some that all people should adopt vegetarian diets as meat is virtually not important in our meals. I completely disagree with this point of view because it is neither justifiable nor scientific.  In my view, it is absurd to ask everyone to become vegetarians. In fact, such a proposal is strongly against the core value of a free and fair society where each individual is entitled to choose the way they eat and live. In this modern world, people should not be forced to adopt any particular lifestyle, no matter how healthy that might be, unless they make the decision by themselves. This freedom to decide on what food they should have is actually one of the important factors influencing the level of happiness for many people.  Apart from the human rights concern expressed above, the argument that people can live healthy without meat also does not hold water. It is scientifically proven that seafood, chicken and beef play a large part in ensuring people’s health. Different types of meat are rich in different nutrition, such as protein, chemicals, and calcium, and they provide what the human body needs and help it function well. Without the nutritional elements that we take from meat, we would be more prone to many health problems, from malnutrition to anemia. That is why WHO suggests that an average adult eat / should eat 50 grams of meat every day.  In conclusion, I believe that it is unreasonable and unhealthy to ask everyone not to consume meat since people should be free to choose their food and enjoy a balanced diet.

"There is no denying the fact that traffic congestion has become a major problem in most metro cities. Critics argue that if the government provides free transportation to their people, it will substantially reduce the traffic related issues. Although I agree with this opinion, I also believe that this proposal could jeopardise a country’s growth over a period of time. On the one hand, free transportation would largely reduce the use of personal vehicles. One of the primary reasons for this heavy traffic in the cities is because of the use of personal cars. A growing number of people are using their own cars heavily to commute to work, for shopping malls, and other daily activities. If the government offers free transport to their people, there is a good chance that the number of vehicles on the roads will be reduced. Hence it is evident that the free public transport idea is not a bad solution for the traffic problem. On the other hand, the free transport proposal could jeopardise a country’s progress severely despite having above-mentioned positives. In many countries, the revenue from public transport is absolutely imperative for the development of other critical sectors, namely health and education. If public transport is made free, the loss of revenue will impact these sectors and over time it will affect the progress of the country. Hence there is convincing evidence that the free transport idea has its own negatives. In conclusion, indeed, traffic congestion is a big concern in almost all the cities. While I agree with the proposal that the free of cost public transport would reduce the traffic problems enormously, I also believe that the negative implications of this idea are severe and cannot be overlooked. I would suggest / recommend that other viable options should be explored to control this menace effectively.",8,False,65.27951590753874,304
"Some people feel blessed and cheerful when they get an opportunity to live in various parts of the world; however, others are happy to live in the same place for their life. In my opinion, it is important to learn about different cultures and places to make our life joyful. On the one hand, people choose to migrate from one place to another as they are keen to learn and acquire knowledge about different cultural aspects and lifestyle. Moreover, exploring various lands and meeting people from different cultural backgrounds is the hobby of many people. Professionals who lack exciting opportunities in their own country are likely to migrate to places where there is a demand for skilled people like them. On the other hand, there are many people who prefer to reside in one area only. This is because they do not want to leave their comfort zone as many formalities and arrangements are required if shifting is involved. Furthermore, family oriented people opt to live within the joint families because they prefer the proximity of family to better career opportunities. For instance, in India, many people live in their ancestral homes as they feel blissful residing in them. In conclusion, there are merits and demerits to staying in one place and frequently changing the place of residence. In my opinion, people who seek newer experiences and challenges are the ones who keep moving from place to place.

"It is often argued that educators have greater responsibility  developing students’ cognitive and social aspects compared to parents. I absolutely agree with this notion, as teachers are well-trained to teach formal lessons. Aside from that, school is the best place for children to socialize and .It is known for a fact that parents play a vital role in the upbringing of their . Nevertheless, educating them at home alone does not always mean leading them to a bright future. For this reason, it is extremely important that children be given a formal education.

"According to some people, if a hobby needs more effort and time then it provides more pleasure to an individual. In my opinion, the difficulty level of a leisure time activity does not determine whether it is enjoyable or not. To begin with, one can relax oneself while performing a favorite activity even though it requires little effort. For example, reading books or listening to songs is the favourite hobby of many people and these activities do not require much effort. Yet, they provide enjoyment and relaxation to those who pursue them. The purpose of a hobby is to utilize the free time in a constructive way. For example, some people prefer to watch movies in their free time and this activity does not require any effort whereas some others prefer to do pottery which requires a lot of practice. The amount of joy and happiness is the same for both individuals irrespective of the difficulty level of the activity they love to do in the free time. Hence, it does not matter how hard or easy the task is. Another crucial reason why the difficulty level of a hobby does not hold any importance is that people adopt an activity as a hobby because that particular act provides them peace of mind and mental stability. Actually, in this day and age when most people have stressful jobs, many of them  are looking for a less demanding hobby.   To conclude, a leisure time activity does not have to be difficult. In fact, watching a movie is as entertaining as climbing a hill. In my opinion, everyone should choose for themselves an activity that they find enjoyable regardless of its difficulty level.

People want to study English for the various advantages associated with it. The most important reason for learning English these days is that English has become the international language of communication in every single part of the world. Although there are only a few countries where English is the first language, it is the most widely spoken language in the world today. Every country releases their official documents in their local language as well as in English to make sure that their message is communicated. Not only within the country but also for tourists English is a common language which is used by tourist guides to help the visitors from different countries.

However, the local government of these countries offers free English translating machines to promote tourism in the country. Another reason for people to travel to English speaking countries for learning English is that learning from native speakers will enable them to acquire the level of proficiency required to clear international English tests. Subsequently, a good level of English helps people to acquire a resident status in the first world countries. For example, last year 30 million people appeared for English exams like TOEFL and IELTS. Learning English not only provides access to information but also throws open a world of opportunities.

"Everything has two sides and the globalization is not  exception. Our first thoughts about this topic include the process of global “McDonaldisation” and, generally speaking, spreading  across the whole Globe. Firstly, I would try to concentrate on the positive aspects of globalisation. As far as economy is concerned, like the Global Bank or IMF are always focused on developing the ‘Third World’ and helping poor people to combat their life obstacles (through loans and donations). Moreover, the world becomes an area of sharing thoughts (e.g. philosophical or economical doctrines), which become popular due to lack of barriers. However, disadvantages of globalization are also widely known. Some people insist that because of this process, the spirit of countries and nations rapidly disappears. The integrity, established  years ago is on the verge of collapsing. Furthermore, there’s a strong lobby of communists who , that the globalization indicates an uncontrolled reign of capitalists and slave work of lower labour-class. We should never forget about the detrimental impact of global investments on the environment – the green house effect or soar rains are triggered by globalization. To sum up, globalization has both positive and negative influence on our everyday life. I can’t agree with the popular statement that we should try to avoid being affected by it.

"Many individuals nowadays prefer to work for themselves rather than being employed in an organisation. The main reason behind this preference is the freedom which people get by working independently. Though there are advantages to working for oneself, the main disadvantage is that there is no guaranteed pay check at the end of the month. The first and foremost reason that encourages people to opt for self employment is the liberty and freedom that comes along with it. That is to say, if an individual is working in an organisation then they will be bound by the rules and regulations of the company and probably have a boss to dictate terms to them. Some people do not like this concept and like to work according to their own ways. For instance, if an individual is employed in the army then he is bound by their rules and regulations. He would have to follow the dress code, meal plans as well as timings. Not everyone appreciates being bound by the rules that someone else has made. The major disadvantage of being self employed is that it requires a great deal of self discipline to succeed. As the person is not dependent or answerable to anyone when working for himself, it becomes very easy to skip deadlines. Furthermore, on skipping deadlines or missing the set targets there will be no one to bear the consequences except he himself. Another downside is the lack of a stable income. It takes years for a self-employed person to establish themselves in their field and until then there is no guarantee that they will earn enough to make a living. In conclusion, the need for liberty and freedom make people want to follow the path of self employment, but they may fail if they deviate from the set targets due to lack of discipline.

"Some people opine that the involvement of grandparents and other members of the immediately family are beneficial for the all round development of children. I totally agree with this view.  When children are raised or brought up in a joint family, it helps them to stay connected to their roots. This is because children are imparted the knowledge regarding their roots and family tree by grandparents. This is usually done by narrating the folklores related to their family history. Hence juveniles would be more aware of their culture when they stay with grandparents. Moreover, including all family members in nurturing children reduces the responsibility of parents. As the cost of living has increased, both parents now work to provide a better life to their children and as such they cannot spend enough time with their little ones or participate in their activities. However, if other family members are taking care of the child, life becomes less stressful for the parents and the child. Furthermore, it helps in keeping a watchful eye on each and every activity of children. During their growing up years children are more likely to indulge in bad activities if they are not kept under supervision. The involvement of the whole family in the upbringing of children makes them less vulnerable to bad influences.  In conclusion, raising children in joint families provides them more security, and gives a good direction to their life; hence this should be encouraged more. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Nowadays, most people follow a sedentary lifestyle, which makes them lazy and inactive. This will cause several health implications for them in the future. This essay will discuss the reasons behind this phenomenon and suggest some viable measures to solve this problem. To begin with, the sedentary lifestyle is the main cause of health problems. These days people are working on laptops or computers, which allow them to sit in chairs continuously for prolonged hours. Also, people find it hard to allot time for exercises because of their work pressure and shift duties. For instance, people working in night shifts, sleep throughout the entire day without being productive or active.  In addition to that, latest technological innovations make people lethargic and depend on the machines blindly. To cite an example, these days people make use of washing machines, dish washers to lessen their burden and also they use lifts or escalators instead of using steps to reach upper floors. These are the causes of the inactive lifestyle followed by people. There are some ways to tackle this problem. One of them is to make people aware of the risks associated with obesity and laziness. Youngsters should be motivated to exercise at least an hour a day by awareness campaigns. Moreover, the governments should build sports centers or parks in every city to encourage their citizens to be active. As a result, people get easier access to these facilities. In conclusion, following an inactive lifestyle and depending more on machines are the major reasons that make people unfit. Their lifestyle can be improved through awareness campaigns and by building more fitness centres. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"While some people argue that creative activities like drawing or painting should be taught at school, others insist that they are useless and should not be part of the curriculum. Both views will be discussed in this essay before arriving at a conclusion. There are several merits to teaching drawing or painting at school. To start with, they foster the creativity of children. The very act of holding a pencil and making shapes on paper improve the motor skills and hand-eye coordination of children. This is the main reason why most schools teach drawing to primary students. Another advantage of including these lessons is that they help children to discover their inherent talents for painting or drawing. Those who have flair of drawing can then join a drawing school to hone their skills. The main argument against making these lessons a part of the curriculum is that they waste the time of children who have no aptitude for drawing. Some parents are also disappointed that these classes rarely teach anything beyond the basics. While these arguments might sound logical, the truth is that drawing benefits everyone. Of course, not all children who learn drawing at school will become an eminent artist when they grow up. However, this is hardly a reason to remove drawing classes from the curriculum. Even if a child does not become a professional painter in the future, she will still benefit from the improved motor coordination skills she acquired through drawing. In conclusion, the argument that drawing lessons are useless does not hold water for the simple reason that the act of drawing improves the cognitive and intellectual skills of all children including those who have no talent for drawing.",9,False,78.56564998539284,284
"It is surprising how common people are becoming popular in no time, thanks to the internet and television. In my opinion, due to the sheer benefits it brings to humanity as a whole, this trend is largely a positive one despite minor misuse by some. To start with, the entertainment industry is dominated by nepotism or by those who have money; thus the less privileged people do not get a chance to prove their talent. Due to this reason, the internet is a blessing for those who wish to achieve fame and showcase their hidden talents independently. For example, apps like Star Maker and TikTok which are especially designed to record videos have gained a lot of popularity and have also made people famous overnight.  However, some maniacs can exploit the media and get the fame. Their published contents and views can influence many uneducated and mentally-ill people to follow them. For instance, some channels on social media platform tend to inspire others to carry out acts of violence. They preach violence in the name of Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and Sikhism and make the society unstable and prevent economic development.  To conclude, it can be said that the internet and television have provided numerous ways for showcasing talents to those individuals who do not have wealth or who are not from reputed families. Despite the fact that these channels could be misused by some miscreants, this trend should be considered as a good one due to the numerous benefits it brings.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In recent years, the use of social media sites has become a widespread trend. Many claim that these sites have a detrimental effect on people and the community. I strongly support this notion, and I will justify my opinion in the following paragraphs with relevant examples. To commence with, the significant impact that these sites have on people is that young individuals who spend excessive amount of time on web surfing become depressed and isolated from their family. This is because they keep themselves locked in rooms for hours and spend most of their time in playing online games or chatting with strangers. Initially, individuals enjoy this habit. However, with the passage of time they become addicted which leads to isolation. To illustrate further, in India’s metro cities, social-media addiction has become a severe issue, and thousands of people seek medical advice / psychiatric advice to overcome this addiction. Therefore, it is evident that social-media addiction has serious implications for people. Furthermore, these sites harm our community. The most critical issue is that there is a significant rise in crime in the society which is due to the misuse of social-media websites. Many attackers hack public profiles of celebrities, which has personal data and pictures and then start blackmailing them. Moreover, there are many cases where criminals target teenage boys and girls by creating fake profiles, and once they fall into their trap, they kidnap them and ask for extortion money from their family.  To conclude, it is clear that social-sites have a negative impact on both people and society, as they lead to isolation among individuals and cause more crimes in the community. Therefore, I firmly believe that it is a negative phenomenon and individuals should be more careful while using such websites.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to some people, youngsters should leave their parental home at a certain age to live an independent life. Others opine that they should live with their parents as long as they can. In my opinion, it is better for young people to live independently after a certain age.  Even though living alone is demanding, it helps the individual to develop a certain mindset and personality. When the child is faced with day to day problems especially financial ones, he will learn to cope up. If they live on their own, such situations will turn them into problem solvers and they will not run to their family for help. By contrast, if youngsters live with their parents, they will instinctively lend a helping hand when they see their children in trouble without comprehending that it is a fierce world and learning to deal with such situations is crucial for their children. While living with parents has its own perks, it also comes with a few downsides. A parent expects a child to follow their ideas and listen to their advice. Even if, this is in their best interest, the world has changed now. For example, while growing up, we were advised to choose engineering as a field of study because it was one of the highly paid professions. These days an engineer earns peanuts compared to most of other professionals. Therefore, it might be in their best interest; still, a child must formulate his life goals based on his own experiences. In conclusion, it is better for a child to leave their parent’s house at a certain age. It is a parent’s duty to decide and plan well in advance. Not only is this better for the mental development of the child but it also teaches them crucial life lessons.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is argued that the popularity of cinemas will reduce dramatically in the coming years because it is a lot more comfortable to watch a film on television or computer than purchasing a ticket to go to cinema. This essay disagrees with the argument that cinemas will become less popular.  Watching movies on a large screen provides better clarity of pictures and a higher level of entertainment and because of these reasons the audience, especially youngsters, will prefer to watch films in cinema theatres. Young adults enjoy going to the cinema because it is a fun and relaxing activity for them.  According to a recent article published in Times of India, a survey was conducted among young people interested in watching films. It was found that about 65 % of the younger generation chose to see movies in theatres along with their friends on weekends in order have a break from the usual routine. So, going to cinema is not only for watching movies but also for having some leisure time with friends and family. Watching movies on a large screen is a more satisfying experience than watching it on a TV or a laptop because the large screen offers more clarity.  While it is comfortable to watch films at home, people choose theaters with precise audio- visual effects because they cannot afford to have such a broad range of accuracy on their small screens. For example, nowadays there has been a rise in 3D and 4D films which can be watched only on specialized devices. Furthermore, watching movies on a big screen often makes people more delighted and satisfied.  To conclude, the popularity of cinema theatres will not diminish as young people enjoy watching movies in the theatre because they provide total entertainment and also because the large screen offers precise sound and visual effects.

"The internet has changed the way we learn. Nowadays, we can learn anything and everything from the comfort of our home using a computer or smartphone. The main advantage of this development is that it allows students to learn at a time and place convenient to them; however, many students find online classes less helpful than regular classes. Online education is a boon for students who cannot attend a regular class due to various reasons. It is particularly suitable for the current times when schools and colleges all over the world are shut due to the Corona Pandemic. However, thanks to internet technologies, academic institutions are still able to deliver lessons to their students. The main advantage of online learning is that it allows students to study at their own pace. If there is a lesson that they find difficult, they can revise it as many times as they want by repeatedly watching the video. This is not exactly possible in the case of regular classroom learning. Affordability is another advantage of online education. Online courses are way cheaper than regular courses.  However, online education has some downsides as well. It is not exactly suitable for students who need someone to constantly monitor their progress. When it comes to online learning, a student’s success depends entirely on their motivation to learn. Another downside of online learning is that it is not easy for students to compare their performance with that of their peers. This can also affect the grades of some students. In a traditional classroom, there is a healthy competition between students to get higher marks. This component is missing in online classrooms. Consequently, many parents and students still prefer regular courses to online courses. Employers also tend to prefer candidates who earned their degrees via the traditional classroom setup. In conclusion, online education allows students to study from anywhere and at any time. However, it is not suitable for very young students or those who lack self-discipline. In a traditional classroom, there are teachers to constantly assess a student’s progress and motivate them to study hard. In online education, a student’s success depends entirely on their level of motivation to study. ",9,False,63.512851405622484,363
"Adolescents in several nations are involved in some type of paid employment. Some individuals believe that this is absolutely incorrect, whereas, others opine that it provides relevant experience which is vital for learning and absorbing responsibilities. This essay will discuss both aspects and argue why it is wrong to engage children in paid labour. One the one hand, employment at a very young age can have several drawbacks. Firstly, there are chances of exploitation by supervisors as kids are very naive. For instance, they may be made to work for longer hours and low wages. Secondly, they may also be bullied by their co-workers causing psychological and emotional issues for them. Lastly, working children find it difficult to focus on their studies and eventually they drop out of school. Unfortunately, this hinders their overall growth and career. On the other hand, there are a few benefits to paid work. The foremost one is that they learn to value money at a young age and spend it wisely which in turn makes them financially secure adults. For children coming from very poor backgrounds, the paid employment could be an opportunity to support their family. However, children can only find manual labour. Since they lack formal educational qualifications, they cannot find a good job that secures their future. And if the job causes them to leave school, it will have disastrous consequences for their future. In conclusion, in my opinion the disadvantages surely outweigh the advantages of engaging children in paid work. Countries should have certain age limitations as to when they can work legally, so their childhood and innocence is not disturbed.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In many modern day families, it is a common aspect of family life that parents give jobs to their children to do around the house to develop their characters and a sense of self-sufficiency. This aspect can be looked at as having both positive and negative sides.When parents give their children jobs or chores to do around the house, they make their children understand that they are part of a community. While this community is only within the family’s house, the lessons children learn from carrying out their chores are equally fitting for the global community they live in. Children are taught that they have to integrate into the global community and that in order for this community to work effectively, everyone must carry out their chores.Furthermore, children learn about the concept of pride, as they are taught to be proud of what they have accomplished. Chores around the house additionally prepare children for living independently later on in life, as they acquire skills that are valuable for everyday life. I, personally, see this approach as very practical; helping my mother with cooking in my childhood and teenage years served me well, and living independently now I don’t have trouble preparing meals for myself and my housemates.Although there are many supporters of this concept, some parents argue that children should not be given jobs to do around the house. They argue that children should be allowed to be children and not have any duties. In their opinion children should enjoy their childhood and should not have to deal with any of the responsibilities adults have to deal with.In conclusion, I believe that giving children chores to carry out is a positive aspect of family life, as I think that it helps children to become independent and makes it easier for them to live by themselves later on in life.",9,False,55.828105599799336,309
"While there is a lot being written about the health effects of excessive consumption of fast food, it is pertinent to ask whether the government should levy higher taxes on this type of food. In my opinion, it should. However, the government cannot shrug off their responsibility by merely / simply imposing extra tax and other effective measures need to be introduced to curb this increased appetite for convenience food. Due to the busy lifestyle people do not get time to prepare nutritious and healthy food at home. Hence, they subsist on ready- made or processed food which has detrimental effect on their health. Conditions like diabetes, heart diseases and obesity are on an upsurge due to this excessive intake. One way of stopping people from eating fast food is to inflate its price. When people consider the impact of this fast food indulgence on their budget, they will automatically reduce its consumption.  However, increasing the prices may sound like a viable alternative but it may not always produce desired results. What is more important is to make people aware of the adverse effects of fast food consumption on a widespread level. The government should formulate policies and initiate awareness campaigns about the ill effects of junk food on people’s health. Although the fast food retailers will protest it, a statutory warning similar to the one displayed on cigarette packets should be printed on the packaging along with the ingredients and the unhealthy caloric value of the processed food. This will eventually make citizens more responsible for their own health To conclude, citizens of a nation are its greatest assets; hence, the government should be responsible for its people’s health and therefore measures like greater taxes on fast food and mind-altering advertisement should be undertaken to make people cognisant of the ill-effects of fast food consumption.

"Undisciplined children might have a negative impact on others and a few people believe that these unruly children should not be educated along with others.  This essay disagrees with the argument that separate education should be provided to disruptive children as it may worsen their behavior. The disorderly behavior at early age may be because of minor psychological issues that are correctable. So, if these children are given a chance to interact with others, they can observe and learn from their classmates and hence this will result in improved character. Moreover, if these little ones are taught in disparate environments, they might feel isolated and this can have adverse impact on them. For instance, a recent study conducted by the University of Delhi found that more than 60 percent of troublesome students who attended normal schools displayed great improvement in their conduct after a year. Sharing classes with disruptive little ones can be advantageous for others as well. As these disorderly children require more attention, the normal ones are likely to help them with their activities and hence, it will impart the value of compassion at a very early age. Also, if students are asked to exhibit good manners for the unruly ones to observe and learn, both will benefit from it. For example, the Times recently reported that students who attended classes with disruptive children were more disciplined than others. In conclusion, disruptive students may have some negative impacts on well-mannered students; however, teaching them separately is not the solution because it will further aggravate their behaviour.

"The way a society functions often reflects its ethos, artistry and talent pursuits. I think it is important for children to achieve proficiency in art subjects. Art plays an indispensable role in shaping and expressing the cultural aspects of any nation. If no one pursued arts, we wouldn’t have exquisite artifacts, sculptures, ornaments, and architectural monuments to boast of. It also helps us understand our ancestors, roots, and evolutionary patterns through previous civilizations. Art has a profound effect on our creativity. Art as a field of work stimulates ingenuity and inventiveness. Many famous artistic discoveries in literature, music, songs and dance forms exemplify the success of art disciplines. The well-known painting of Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, resplendent facade and breath-taking design of Taj Mahal by Shajahan and, Eiffel tower in Paris are just a few illustrations. Likewise, many forms of music such as classical, jazz and rock performances have emerged through arts. Furthermore, art gives a platform for students to explore the hidden potentials and offers them better career alternatives. Even people from less privileged backgrounds can change their life by showcasing their artistic prowess. For example, last year the winner of India’s Got Talent hailed from a humble background. This contestant not only earned huge prize money but also got opportunities in upcoming films. Lastly, I feel it is less likely that all students will be interested in pursuing mainstream subjects. In order to have a balanced society, it is imperative that considerable proportion of students study art subjects. We need as many artists, painters, musicians, historians and media professionals as we need doctors, engineers and scientists. In summary, I believe that art greatly influences our cultural and historical knowledge in a positive way. Artistic achievements benefit individuals and society at large. New talents are unearthed. Therefore, I feel that children should be encouraged to take art subjects; however, they should be given a choice. Preferring art subjects over others should not be the norm.

"The major reason behind the popularity of foreign films is the presence of internationally acclaimed directors and actors. International award functions like the Oscars and film festivals like the Cannes get wide media coverage all over the world. This has also contributed to the popularity of foreign films. Technological advancements in foreign films are another reason for their mass appeal. Technology has taken entertainment to an altogether new level.

On the flip side, there is a different class of audience for regional films. Film industries in Japan, China and Scandinavia mainly produce films based on their culture. These films enjoy huge popularity in their countries. In my opinion, the governments can play a vital role in helping the local film industry survive. For example, the governments can provide tax relief to movies based on local culture. They should also provide interest free loans to regional film makers.

"It is indeed true that the students who belong to poor families or backward areas are less likely to acquire higher education. While reserving seats for financially weak students would put other deserving students in difficult situation, I believe that if they are assisted financially, both the student and the society will be benefited. If universities enroll students based on their background, it will be unfair to the students who have comparatively higher grades. In India, for example, there are already lots of reserved categories on the basis of caste. If one more is added, it will make the education system more unfair in terms of equality. Therefore, the place of birth or financial difficulties should not be considered while giving admission to students. However, if universities help students of poor families and rural areas by offering them free education, it will be advantageous for the student as well as the society. If they do not have to pay tuition fee meritorious students from poor families can also go to university and receive education that may eventually change their destiny.

"Some people think that values such as honor and kindness have become unimportant and the only important thing is the amount of money a person has. I strongly disagree with this statement and I will explain the reasons below. There is no doubt that respect towards richer people has increased in the last few decades, so, the more income you have, the more respected you will be. However, this does not mean that a rich person is more valued. For example, someone who has a lot of money and does not share his wealth is going to be seen as a selfish person. People neither like nor respect them. By contrast, rich people who serve the society through their charitable acts receive a lot of adulation and admiration. Take, for instance, the case of Bill Gates. He is one of the most respected persons in the whole world but that is not because he is the richest man. Rather what made him so respectable is his philanthropic work. There are also lots of celebrities like actors and sports persons who work for charitable institutions. They use their fame and influence to gather support for the causes they believe in. They also attract a lot of respect. For instance, in Spain, my country, there is an actor couple who quit their profession to volunteer for a charity helping poor children. These actors are well recognized because of their kind acts and not because of their money. In conclusion, I firmly believe that money will certainly increase a person’s social standing; however, old values such as kindness and generosity are still very much cherished and in order to win the true love and admiration of their fellow citizens rich people have to show kindness and generosity.",8,False,77.65353814881563,294
"In this era of technology, television is no more considered as a luxury; rather it is a necessity. However, it is often argued by many people that television has hindered the communication between friends and families while others tend to disagree with that argument. I personally think that television plays no role in maintaining friendship nor does it have anything to do with family ties. It is an individual’s responsibility to communicate with their friends and families on a regular basis. Television is considered as a one of the greatest inventions by humans. It keeps us updated on the latest news from around the world. People follow various channels from across the world which suits their interest. Many youngsters watch their favorite show together which gives them a common topic of discussion. Television has also brought many cultures together. Many a time families connect over dinner and discuss their favorite shows. For instance, many reality television shows such as Indian Idol and Master Chef provide a platform to talented people to showcase their skills to the world. This also provides new opportunities for friendship. However, the negative impact of television cannot be ignored. Some people are so much habituated to watching TV that it has become a kind of addiction to them. They tend to ignore their social and personal life because of this. This habit of theirs has also impacted their health. They are more comfortable, sitting in front of a TV, enjoying their favorite show rather than doing any physical activity. Unfortunately, this makes them obese and unhealthy.  In conclusion, television has clearly brought entertainment to our lives; however, spending too much time watching TV is never a good idea. As long as a there is a balance between the time spent in front of the TV and time spent with friends and families, no one can say that the television has impacted the relations of people.

"Sky trains are suggested as a method to reduce congestion in urban areas. This essay will discuss the benefits and downsides of the introduction of this facility into city life. On the one hand, sky trains have some favourable effects on urban areas. First, sky trains can be operated even in space constrained cities. Cities are highly dense areas with many business entities and accordingly there are umpteen employees and customers. The concentration of population in these areas is particularly high during working hours. There is not enough space to construct public transportation to accommodate the moving population. Running sky trains can alleviate the level of congestion on grounds. Second, it can be beneficial to relieve stress. A specific feature of sky trains is that they are operated in the air. While people are on board, they can appreciate scenery by looking out of windows. Compared to the subway system the exposure to open space on sky trains can refresh or rejuvenate people who are exhausted from work. On the other hand, sky trains have unfavourable aspects as well. First, it can trigger privacy invasion. Sky trains are operated up in the air, which enables passengers, unknown strangers, to invade people’s privacy, whose residence or offices are adjacent to and at similar or lower level than them. It is not pleasant to expose private space to the public.  Second, it can make noise pollution along the sky tracks. It is operated from early in the morning to midnight, which can generate noises around at stations for three fourths of a day. It can have a considerable effect on residents and some of them might suffer from sleep deprivation. It can lead to illness if people have to deal with the lack of sleep for an extended period.  In conclusion, sky trains are considered one method to mitigate congestion. This infrastructure can provide boons such as dispersion of commuters and opportunities to release stress, whereas it can provoke some issues including privacy invasion and the noisy environment.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some educated and highly skilled individuals prefer to migrate to more developed nations and work there. There are many reasons for this trend and also it leads to many problems. This is caused by the belief that they could secure better paid jobs in rich countries. However, this migration could affect the economic situation in their home countries.  The primary reason skillful people leave for other countries is the better job prospects in richer nations. Despite their education and skills, many people are not paid well enough to make ends meet in their countries. For example, in Egypt, doctors in public hospitals secure an income of only 50 dollars per month. As a result, they will travel to Western European countries where doctors’ monthly wages are tremendously higher. The advancement opportunities are also better in more developed countries. An engineer working in a German enterprise can move forward into a managerial role in the company after some years. However, in many Chinese companies, the management board is usually made up of family members. Many Chinese workers cannot advance, even though they are skilled and educated. Therefore, they seek work in other countries with better career prospects / with better opportunities for career growth. This trend positively affects the economy of the developed country. In other words, the educated and highly experienced immigrants usually secure well-paid jobs, and hence they pay higher taxes. The money is then allocated by the government for national healthcare, education, transportation and housing. Thus, they contribute to the betterment of the society. However, their home countries will suffer great losses in services. If doctors and teachers immigrate to other countries, the healthcare and education system will face a shortage of personnel to help the population.

"Young people are no longer interested in reading newspapers or watching news programmes on television. There are many reasons behind this and the most important one is that youngsters are no longer dependent on television on print media for news and information. They can get updates on the go from the internet. There are several reasons why newspapers are not being read by young people in many countries. The most important one is the evolution of information technology. One no longer has to read a newspaper to stay updated of the latest happenings in the world. It is now possible to get instant updates from websites like Google and Twitter. Another reason for this loss of interest in newspapers and news channels is the outdated way of presentation. Youngsters need byte sized information and lack the patience to read long news reports. Also, they have little interest in topics such as politics and business which receive undue coverage in traditional media. However, youngsters should be encouraged to read newspapers because these are authentic sources of information. This is not exactly the case with social media where gossips spread faster than truths. In order to win the attention of young people, newspapers should find out what they are interested in. Likewise, news channels should create content that caters to their needs. It is proven that youngsters like to read about sports, stories and movies. To draw their attention towards the newspaper and news channels, these stories should be given more coverage. Moreover, to persuade them to read a newspaper, we should tell them about the benefits they can reap from reading newspapers. To conclude, young people don’t read newspapers because they can receive news updates from other sources like the internet. Also they are not interested in the topics discussed in newspapers and on news channels. However, by creating content that interests young readers, newspapers and news channels can win their attention.",8,False,64.2,321
"Today most of us live a sedentary lifestyle and therefore doing some physical activity to keep ourselves healthy is of utmost importance. In fact, in my opinion physical exercises should be introduced in schools itself. This essay will put forth some reasons to support my view. There are many advantages to introducing physical activities at the school level. The first and the most significant benefit is the improvement in the health of students. Physical activity increases the blood circulation in the body and thus helps in the proper growth of bones and muscles. In addition to that, sports and games offer students a refreshing break from their monotonous routine of studies and homework. For example, a short recess during school hours provides students a much needed break and helps them focus properly on their lessons when the class resumes. The sports period will also help to reenergize the children. Moreover, sports inculcate in children some life skill such as cooperation, coordination etcetera. To exemplify, playing a team sport like cricket or football helps students understand the importance of team work, coordination and cooperation. These skills will provide them a head start when they start their professional life. Different types of sports can be incorporated by the schools depending upon the infrastructure availability. If open ground is available outdoor sports like football, hockey, volleyball and cricket can be introduced; else indoor games like chess are a good option. Playing chess develops the strategy making skill in students and other games like scramble increase the vocabulary. Thus they prove beneficial for studies too. To conclude, sports and games are necessary for school going children and they must be made a part of the school curriculum along with other important subjects. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Discuss both sides and give your opinion. Some people argue that exploring space involves too much investment and time, while others think it is required for mankind’s survival. In this essay, I will discuss both views and express my opinion. Space research requires huge amounts of money which can be invested for meeting the basic needs of the people. Countries like Somalia are unable to fulfill the basic needs of their citizens. Food, clothing and shelter form a primary need for the mankind and these should take precedence before any other development. Therefore, it is important to satisfy the primitive needs before spending money on exploration of universe. Developed countries should help the poor countries to build these amenities instead of spending on space. On the other hand, it also seems important to research the planets and the universe. If we had not done enough research on space, we would not have found about the ozone depletion and annual rise in earth’s temperature. Because of this research we had the opportunity to learn more about the planet we live in, and plan to safeguard the Earth from unexpected disasters. Also, space research has helped us to understand the nature and the precautions we should take for natural calamities. To conclude, even though space research provides significant knowledge about our planet and the universe, I think we should initially spend on delivering basic needs of the people. Once adequate funds are allocated for this, we can then look into space research and explore more about the galaxies.",7,False,62.614609601821876,256
"Cultural similarities which did not exist in the past are now evident across the globe. This is because of tourism and the internet revolution. In my opinion, this is a positive development as it saves people from discrimination and increases employment opportunities in many countries. The world has become more connected due to increase in travel. This is because nowadays, many people travel a lot to different countries and get to know the different cultures around the world, whereas in the past travel was limited. Some even migrate to other countries due to their liking for foreign cultures. Furthermore, understanding different cultures has never been easier than today with the use of the internet. People try to learn different cultures through websites and tend to generate an interest in them. This, in turn, promotes cultural homogeneity. I believe this is a positive development because cultural fusion enables people to work in foreign countries without experiencing much difficulty. When people all over the world eat the same kind of foods, wear the same kind of clothes and celebrate the same festivals, life becomes a whole lot easier. Also, this development creates more job opportunities in developing countries.  When there is a general acceptance of the foreign cultures, foreign businesses can set up offices everywhere.  To recapitulate, cultural similarities are a result of the booming travel industry and greater access to the internet. This should be seen as a positive development because it makes the world more tolerant and promotes job opportunities, especially, in developing and under developed countries.

"There are an increasing number of languages disappearing by the year. People believe that this occurrence is not important as their life will become simpler as a result of this phenomenon. I completely disagree with this opinion and this essay will elaborate on the reasons why. Firstly, language serves as the backbone of any culture in a society. If a language were to vanish, the culture and practices will diminish with it as well. Culture is important to a society as it is essential to preserving the uniqueness and diversity of our civilisation. If these languages were to die out, I believe that the livelihoods of these people will greatly be affected as they will now need to learn a new language and adapt to a brand new culture. Should such an event happen, various small communities in China and India who speak minority languages will face these difficulties in adjusting to the changes. Secondly, I believe that the complexities of life are not caused by the multitude of languages that exist in the world. Rather they are a result of the gap in communication that arises from factors such as the lack of respect for one another and negligence of one’s daily activities. For instance, we can put two people who speak completely different languages in a room. If the respect each other, the language barrier is unlikely to create any issues between them. On the other hand, it could also be observed that two people who speak the same language may very well end up in a dispute.  To summarize, I believe that life will only become more simplified when the mankind shows the resolve to bridge the gap in their everyday communication. Having fewer languages is not part of the problem and will not aid in making our lives easier. On the contrary, it could produce an opposite effect as people may find trouble coping with the changes should this situation happen.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"These days, few children play a physical sport like football or basketball. Actually, they are spending most of their time playing computer games. Unfortunately, this has raised several concerns over their physical and emotional health. In my opinion, it is not beneficial for children to spend too much time playing games on the computer. Computer games are becoming more and more popular among children because they have brought fun and entertainment to the living room. These days, almost every home has a computer and gaming console. This easy access to digital games encourages children to play them whenever they get an opportunity. Also, these games are addictive in nature. They have multiple levels and provide instant gratification. Moving from one level to the next makes children feel good about their skills and want to play more. Another factor driving the popularity of computer games is the lack of convenient access to playgrounds in urban areas. Of course, there is no harm in playing computer games every now and then. They enable children to spend their free time on their own. However, young children are not supposed to be sitting in front of the computer all day long. They have to step out of their home and get physically active by playing a sport with their friends. When children play sports and games, their mental as well as physical health improves. Playing a team sport like football helps children acquire interpersonal and team skills which will benefit them when they enter the workplace in future. Computer games, on the other hand, only provide entertainment. They might also improve the hand-eye coordination of children. Aside from that, they offer hardly any benefits. Worse still, children who spend a lot of time playing video games tend to develop various physical ailments such as obesity, neck pain and poor eyesight. In conclusion, playing computer games for hours on end is definitely harmful for children and this practice cannot be encouraged. Parents and teachers should encourage them to play actual sports by reducing their screen time and giving easy access to playgrounds.",9,False,87.81580233443577,347
"Online shopping has been gaining tremendous popularity these days. I opine that this method of buying has both advantages and disadvantages and it is hard to say whether advantages outweigh disadvantages. Buying from virtual stores has become a part of our daily life because of the many benefits of this practice. First, you can save a considerable amount of time and efforts by using online shops. You can save a considerable amount of time and efforts by using online shops. You can cut down on your physical activities related to shopping and the time and energy thus saved can be used for some other purpose / to accomplish something else. You can boost your productivity in those areas and produce a more desirable result. To illustrate, you are a student who is preparing for civil service examination. If you purchase groceries and receive them at home, you can secure more time and energy to study or rest. Second, when you buy online, you can easily compare prices without visiting several stores. Most companies are operating their own website to promote sales. Consumers can have access to as many websites as they need and compare prices. Thus, online shopping guarantees the best deals to them.  Contrary to these merits, online shopping has some unfavourable aspects as well. First, it takes relatively longer time to receive or return purchased items than offline shopping. It requires a certain amount of time to get the product delivered when we shop online. This feature is inevitable. Second, consumers can receive products that fail to live up to their expectations. Even if online shopping malls provide several images in different angles and comments from other customers, individuals have different anticipations. Hence, it is difficult to satisfy all customers’ needs. In conclusion, online shopping is one of the mainstreams in modern society. It has not only several boons but also downsides stemming from features of online shopping; therefore, it is hard to say whether its advantages exceed its disadvantages.

"According to some people, spending free time by watching a particular sport is just killing precious time. However, I disagree with the statement as in my opinion it is a useful activity and has many benefits of its own. To begin with, by watching sports in leisure time, one can learn several things such as cooperation and team spirit. Sports teams exhibit a tremendous level of team spirit that one can apply in one’s daily life. Also, while watching the game, we can gain immense knowledge about it. Moreover, watching sports with our loved ones is a great opportunity to spend some quality time with them. Better still, cheering together for our favourite team brings us closer. Hence, watching sports offers many benefits that are much needed in every sphere of life. Sports lovers often have role models that fascinate them the most. One tries to copy them and follow their secrets to stay fit and ultimately gets benefited by adopting healthy lifestyles. Some of them get inspired and choose sports as their career. For example, the present captain of Indian Cricket team Mahinder Singh Dhoni was inspired by former captain Sunil gavasker and dreamt of becoming like him. With substantial amount of dedication and hard work he achieved it. So, there are many such stories where a particular sport has inspired people. In conclusion, watching sports in leisure time is a good way of spending time and for some people this hobby may even turn into a career.  So, people should encourage their children to develop interest in sport by watching it and participating in it whenever possible.

"Demand   for new houses is increasing day by day in urban areas, although there is a shortage of land available for this purpose. The only solution to this problem is to build homes in the rural area. However, some people opine that the countryside should not be used for building residential buildings, but I completely disagree with this argument.  First and foremost, due to the growing population more and more people are migrating to big cities in search of better jobs, life style and education. This results in space constraints in these metropolitan cities. So the only solution to get rid of congestion in cities is to build homes in the rural area. Building homes away from cities will also reduce the problem of traffic jams in urban areas. People will not have to waste hours in traffic jam daily. Last but not least, it will be helpful for improving the lifestyle of people living in the countryside as the price of property will increase benefitting the local community. These residential buildings will open doors for new business setups, services such as restaurants, shopping malls and gymnasiums. A good example of this is the city of Chandigarh. The area in which Chandigarh was developed was completely rural with almost no job opportunities, and educational institutions. However the development of this completely new settlement opened doors for new job opportunities and it resulted in holistic development of local residents. To conclude, in my opinion building homes in the countryside is a win-win situation for all the stakeholders. It eases the space constraints and traffic congestion in cities. At the same time, it improves the standard of living in rural areas. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"A few scientists believe that we must establish contact with intelligent beings on other planets; however, others believe that it is a risky idea and can have disastrous consequences. In my opinion, contacting people from other planets can open new doors and widen our thoughts about other living beings; hence sending messages to other intelligent life forms is a good idea. To start with, human beings have been persistently improving their knowledge over the years and the main reason behind the drastic development of human race was the urge to explore the unknown things. Furthermore, contacting other living forms is a great opportunity for humans to get exposure to the unknown facts and widen their horizons. Consequently, this exploration may unearth the facts and information about people living on other planets and shed light on some of the hidden or misunderstood facts about other planets in our solar system. On the other hand, a few scientists believe that sending messages to aliens is a bad idea and can prove to be very dangerous. They believe that nobody can deny the fact that the operation to find other living forms may be a risky business. In addition to this, they may be more intelligent and shrewd than humans and can destroy our environment. Furthermore, the possibility of the intelligent life forms destroying humans to occupy our planet cannot be ruled out and should be thought about before initiating the operation to explore other planets for these alien life forms. To conclude, humans have always initiated risky operations to satisfy their hunger for knowledge. This has always been the major reason for the dramatic development of human race. Hence exploring other planets for living forms may be risky but can open the door for the betterment of human race.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

". There are two factors that influence their decisions. The first is the kind of customers they aim at.  each kind of readers and watchers has its own features. For example, if your customers are almost entirely teenagers, you have to concentrate on something attracting them such as stories, photographs of singer stars, film stars, funny tales, and fashion. It  be very silly if you  to provide teenagers with economic or  news. On the contrary,  and politicians may never read news about James Blunt or Keira Knightley. Therefore, what influences news editors’ decisions the most is the taste of their customers.The second factor is how hot and attractive the news is. Who  or watch news from a year or a month ago or even about something that happened last week? The answer is . In the energetic and competitive world nowadays, people always ask for a really  news. So that to satisfy customers, there is a pressure on all editors to find continually what has already happened not only yesterday but even an hour ago. Or else, they may lose their customers. None of editors wants that bleak future.The type of news is also an important consideration. Whether on television or in newspapers, we seem to get more of and become used to bad news. It is harder for us to come across a piece of good news. We can’t deny that bad things happen on Earth day by day. However, news editors try to gain more and more , which means more and more money, using bad news as a magnet.  bad news makes us curious. We want to know why it is bad, what it is about, whether it influences us or not. As a result, we will buy newspapers or watch television to find out. And the happiest people are, of course, news editors.In my view it would be better if more good news  reported. Bad news makes us  good news makes us happy. There should an an equal amount of good and bad news. In that way we can give something bad a lot of thought while still being happy about the good news.

"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task and write at least 250 words. It is thought by some experts that learning a foreign language when children are in their pre-school age instead of secondary level is more beneficial. I think that learning a foreign language at an early stage can bring about more benefits than disadvantages for children. Firstly, students can develop better understanding of other cultures by learning their language. This helps them to break the barrier of communication when they prefer to continue their studies abroad. Secondly, learning a language other than their mother tongue will help them in their job hunt. For instance, most of the job interviews, nowadays, are conducted in English. Therefore those who are fluent in this international language can find jobs easily. Thirdly, preschool age is the best time to imbibe a language. Admittedly, there are some issues involved while children learn a foreign language. One problem is that students and their parents give more importance to that language than their own dialect. Take, for instance, the case of children studying in international schools. They rarely concentrate on their mother tongue and as a result they don’t have good reading or writing skills. However, this situation is rare, only happening to certain students. Another negative aspect is that children prefer to study in such schools that teach other languages regardless of the money they need to spend. This leads to fewer admissions in ordinary schools causing them to close down. This can affect children from poor financial background. In conclusion, the critical benefits that children gain by learning a foreign language will stand them in good stead when they become adults and clearly outweigh any disadvantages.

"Language is a way to communicate your ideas, thoughts and opinions with other people. English is one of the languages that is often considered essential to learn in today’s world. There is a considerable decline in the interest to learn the local languages. In fact, some of them are on the verge of dying out. In my opinion, it is important for everyone to learn English. At the same time, it is equally important to preserve local languages. Firstly, English is the official language in more than 50 countries most of which are well-developed nations where one might be interested in settling down in the future. English speaking skills will come in handy in situations when you are trying to migrate abroad. The English speaking countries such as the US, the UK and Canada are considered to be the best destinations for higher education. One must, therefore, have a strong command of the language in order to successfully thrive in an English speaking country. In addition, the job opportunities for an individual with better English skills are numerous. The employers are only interested in those candidates who can have a good conversation with their clients and express their opinions fluently. This skill is extremely important in this age of globalisation as the clients of the employers are often from different parts of the world. A good knowledge of English is also required to make the best use of information available on the internet because most of the websites are in English. However, I feel the local languages should also be taught so as to preserve them for future generations. There are many scriptures and books written in local languages that are full of knowledge and wisdom. For example, the books on Ayurveda, a traditional healing practice, are written in Sanskrit. As many people are leaning towards natural healing therapy, it has become all the more important to learn and preserve the minority languages that allow us to decipher such ancient texts. Including these languages in the school curriculum is one of the ways to preserve them. Parents should make an effort to teach their children by regularly conversing with them in their mother tongue. Also, the Government should provide incentives such as scholarship to students with local language skills. To conclude, I believe that English is necessary to succeed in all walks of life as it makes one more confident. Nevertheless, the local language also needs to be given their due respect. I feel an equal effort should be made by individuals to learn both these languages.",8,False,59.26149846138656,426
"Some people believe that schools do not give enough importance to teaching health related topics. I certainly disagree with the statement as teachers design the school curriculum in such a manner that it covers maximum content on health. It is true that there is no particular subject that directly teaches about health. However, schools try to teach health lessons along with the main course in an innovative way. For example, young children are taught  the importance of hand washing from the beginning. Also, they are provided with diet that is low in calorie and saturated fats and healthy drinks in the school cafeteria. In this manner, they are introduced to healthy food options. Seminars on healthy food choices are conducted from time to time to emphasise more on healthy food choices. Moreover, some schools organize competitions in which children prepare food and explain its nutritional value. Thus, children are taught the importance of healthy diet in a creative way.  Another way schools teach young people about health is through sports activity. Children learn the benefits of sports / physical activity while playing it. They become more active and fit. Apart from this, special health education on controlled substances and sex education is provided to prevent the teenagers from indulging in unhealthy practices that can have detrimental effects on health.  In conclusion, school contributes in different ways that benefits the health of young children and helps them incorporate healthy lifestyles that will stand them in good stead for their future.

"Many languages that were once in use have become defunct / extinct now. Some people argue that fewer languages make the world an easier place to live in. In my opinion, a few common languages for the entire world can make people’s lives easier; however, saving minority languages along with their culture will make the world an interesting place. The existence of only a few common languages certainly makes life easier for people. When people of different countries speak a common language, it makes traveling and trading easier. For instance, while traveling to a foreign country such as Thailand people struggle to navigate their way to the hotel or various tourist attractions in the country because many local people don’t speak any language other than their mother tongue. In addition, starting a new business and running it successfully in a foreign country is difficult due to the language barrier. In my personal experience, as a business man from India I found it difficult to run my new business in Indonesia as most of my customers could not speak English. Thus it is evident that speaking a few common languages will make the world an easier place to live in. On the other hand, one beautiful thing about this world is its diversity in culture and languages. As people adopt one common language and refuse to speak and study their own language, the world is losing its diversity. Losing a language means losing a culture as well; therefore it is important to save languages to make the world a beautiful and multicultural place. In conclusion, minority languages are disappearing from the world because their own speakers refuse to learn and speak them. At the same time, languages like English are becoming more and more popular. In my opinion, it is true that a few common languages for the entire world can make people’s life less complicated; however, saving dying languages along with their culture can make world a beautiful place to live in.",8,False,55.97111889753219,331
"As our society progresses and the quality of life increases, more people are living longer in various parts of the globe. I believe that this development has both positive and negative effects on our society and this essay will explore the reasons why. On the one hand, the rise in the number of old folks having longer life expectancies signifies a better standard of living. This is credited to our advancement in sanitisation and medical care, all of which are an added advantage to us. Seniors can contribute to the family by taking care of the children while young adults are at work. This allows the elderly to enjoy the company of the young, while being able to babysit them at the same time. On the other hand, too many old people would mean that the working force would have to be taxed higher and they would have to work harder to support the elderly. This would put a strain on the nation’s budget as a larger portion would have to be set aside to support this need. In some developed countries like Japan and France, the increase in the number of elderly could be viewed as a negative development as that means their population as a whole was experiencing a low birth rate.  To conclude, it is a positive development that more people are able to live longer and it should be celebrated. However, the rise in the number of the elderly must also be proportionate to the rise in babies in order for each country to ensure that their population remains well balanced. A country that swings in two extremes will not be healthy for everyone. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Crime is a serious problem across the globe and all countries are trying to deal with this pressing issue. A section of the society believe that prison sentences for a longer duration can help to reduce the crime, whilst others disagree and argue that there are other better ways to solve this. This essay agrees with the argument that alternative ways such as educating people and giving them resources to earn are far more beneficial than confining them to a prison cell. This essay will discuss both points of view. There are a number of people who think that offenders should be punished with longer prison sentences because this phenomenon can invoke / generate fear in a criminal’s mind. In other words, if a person is already aware of the intensity of punishment before committing any crime, it will discourage him from becoming a criminal. For example, in the UAE, the rapist and the murderer usually get lifetime prison sentences, resulting in making people think twice before committing any serious crime. Hence, imposing strict punishment deters people from committing crime.   However, I believe that alternative ways such as providing proper education facilities and employment can solve the issues far more effectively and I agree with them. Sufficient education and job opportunities keep the masses busy and nobody will try to commit any offence. Furthermore, people / citizens will have some goals in their lives to fulfill, which keeps them away from negative thoughts. To exemplify, in Sweden education is free for everyone and the country’s authority is continuously working for more employment options. That is the reason why Sweden tops the list of peaceful countries.  In conclusion, longer prison terms certainly instill fear in the minds of potential criminals and discourage them from committing crime. However, eradicating the root cause of crime by providing education and employment opportunities is a better option. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Air Pollution which is a significant cause of environmental problems has become a widespread issue globally. Many people argue that that the best way to resolve this issue is to hike the price of gasoline and vehicles. While I agree that this solution is helpful to some extent, there are other vital solutions which are equally useful. It is evident that by increasing the price of fuel and bikes and cars, we will be able to reduce pollution. This is because if there are fewer cars and motorcycles on the street, there will be less air pollution in the city because vehicles are the main cause of such pollution.  To illustrate, to solve the environmental problems, Singapore has added huge taxes on buying new vehicles. This has deterred locals from buying them. As a result, the government is able to control pollution.  However, there are also other ways to deal with this issue. One major solution is to provide a robust public transport system and provide subsidy to residents who use it. If residents have the option to commute via buses and trains which are cheaper and comfortable, they will start using them on a regular basis. Consequently, it will result in fewer cars on the road, which eventually means less air pollution.  For example, London has a huge network of metro trains and buses, which are quite affordable. Therefore, locals prefer to use them instead of their private vehicles. In conclusion, environmental issues can be controlled by raising the prices of vehicles and gasoline; however, other measures like providing efficient public transport and subsidy to residents could be equally beneficial in combating this issue.

"Criminal proceedings are broadcast on television for the general public in certain countries. In my opinion, while this may create awareness about judicial proceedings, the drawbacks of this practice outweigh the benefits.  Admittedly, there are some advantages to showing criminal trials on television. This creates awareness among the common people about the procedures involved in the trial. It also enables people to learn about the various provisions of the law. For example, in most countries, a murder committed in self defense is not punishable. When people watch these shows they become aware of such aspects of the law. Sometimes the airing of trial procedures also enables people to get justice faster. In many countries, judicial procedures are extremely slow and sometimes it takes several years for victims to get justice. When people learn about such delays through these programmes, they may demand speedy delivery of justice.  Nevertheless, the downsides of this practice are more dangerous. For example, it could teach criminals ways to escape from punishment and might also violate human rights. As part of the court hearing, a detailed visualization of the crime scene would be given. Potential criminals may plot similar crimes after watching these proceedings. They may also learn about the loopholes in the law that would help them get away. Another imperative concern is that sometimes young children could be the victim or the culprit. In both cases, showing their faces or family members during the trails may cause psychological disturbance in them as well as in the society. They may face bullying or isolation from the people who watched them on TV. Thus, public hearing on national television tutors the criminals about the loopholes in the system and psychologically affects the victims and the accused. In conclusion, although there are merits to both sides of this argument, I think that the damage that could happen due to the airing of criminal proceedings would have more detrimental effects on the society than the benefits.

"People have different views on how medical research should be conducted and tested. Although many people support the use of  for developing medicines, I personally believe that animal testing is morally wrong.The main reason why some people value  to conduct medical research is because animal testing has contributed to many life-saving cures and treatments. It is true that nearly every medical breakthrough in the last 100 years has resulted directly from research using animals. For example, experiments in which dogs had their pancreases removed led directly to the discovery of insulin, critical to saving the lives of diabetics. Furthermore, it is impossible to release  to the market before proving it  no harm to humans and laboratory mice are appropriate research subjects because they are similar to human beings in many ways.However, I  people who consider medical development that involved the use of animals  cruel and unacceptable. I believe that the lives of all creatures should be respected and we, humans, have no right to  for our own benefits. Governments should invest in developing alternative methods that can replace   when doing medical research. For example, a software program can be developed to model a human immune system and new drugs can be tested on the software rather than animals. In this way, no animals will suffer from the medical tests and the society can still benefit from medical development.In conclusion, although it is undoubtedly true that animal testing has helped scientists in drug developments and medical discoveries, I believe that the benefits to humans do not justify the suffering caused to animals and we should use alternative methods when doing medical research that do not involve animals suffering.",8,False,74.76136613222053,276
"Adolescents are increasingly committing crimes in certain societies. Some people argue that adolescents should receive the same punishment as adults for committing serious crimes. I agree with this statement because of the reasons which will be discussed in this essay. Adolescents are mature enough to understand what is right and wrong. This is because in the modern society, they are exposed to various sources of information in the world through online and offline media. Unlike the teenagers of previous generations, young adults in the current society know just about everything. They know how to differentiate moral activities from immoral activities. Obviously, they are required to behave appropriately all the time. When children between the age of 12 and 19 commit crimes, it is necessary that they should be punished appropriately in order to control their immoral behaviours. They should be punished in the same way as adults and it will become a lesson to all teenagers. If the judicial system is lenient towards young adults in terms of punishment, they will take it as an advantage and repeat crimes in future. Recently, in India some people brutally raped an eight year old girl. A teenager is also involved in this heinous crime. According to the police reports, the teenager who was involved in the crime inflicted more pain and injury to the child than adults. If this boy is not given the same punishment as other adults, it is sure that he will repeat the same offense in future. Lives of many young girls will be jeopardised if the legal system does not punish him adequately. In conclusion, teenagers should also be given the same punishment as adults in order to control their criminal tendencies because they are mature enough to differentiate legal activities from illegal activities.",8,False,65.45638756077572,295
"It is true that average life expectancy has increased significantly because of the advances made in the field of medical science. In my opinion, this is generally a positive development; however, it also means that more resources are required for taking care of the elderly. Longer life expectancy does not necessarily mean that a person will remain healthy throughout their life. Older people need medical and nursing care more frequently and they have more number of sick days per year. This means societies need more doctors, nursing staff, healthcare facilities and home care facilities to care for their ageing population. In addition, with the increase in the number of retired people the government spending on pension schemes and other welfare services will also increase exponentially. Furthermore, more retired people also means lower tax revenue. All these issues will ultimately put a tremendous burden on the working young population. However, increasing life expectancy also has many advantages to the individual, their family and the government. Firstly, the obvious benefit of this is that people can live longer with their family and travel to various places. They can enjoy life longer and contribute more to the society. Secondly, families can also get benefit from their wisdom and experience. They can give valuable advice and emotional support to younger generation in difficult times. They also take care of their grandchildren and teach them various life skills, moral and cultural values. Finally, the government can also benefit from the elderly. They can make elderly people more productive either by increasing the age of retirement or by availing their services in non labour intensive managerial community work. In conclusion, while increased lifespan has brought about many problems, in my view, the advantages of this development far outweigh the disadvantages.",8,False,89.45529486366519,294
"According to some people national boundaries will disappear in the not-so-distant future. Others, however, contest this view. In my opinion, geographical boundaries will always exist and they are required too.  On the one hand, if countries do not have any borders separating them, people can travel freely and explore the world as much as they can. The lack of boundaries may also boost trade and thus benefit the economy. For example, countries like Singapore and Malaysia have no borders between them and hence people can travel freely. They do not need a visa or have to go through security checkups before they can enter the other territory. Of course, these two countries enjoy good relationships and as such the lack of border between them is only beneficial for them.  On the flip side, not every nation enjoys a good relationship with their neighbours. For example, a border is a must between India and Pakistan. This is essential to stop infiltrators from entering the country. Likewise, there is a strong border between the United States and Mexico and still controlling the flow of drugs from Mexico to the US is quite hard. We can imagine what would happen if there were no borders between these countries. Obviously, borders are crucial for maintaining law and order. They prevent anti-social elements from entering the country.  In conclusion, while it is true that there is no place for borders in a perfect world, ours is far from perfect and hence national boundaries are required to check criminal activities and maintain law and order. Therefore, in my opinion, they are here to stay. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate. ",9,False,72.49206922976822,288
"Some people think that public libraries are no longer important, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your opinion. Here is a band 9 IELTS essay on this topic. Need help with IELTS writing? Get your IELTS essays, letters and reports corrected by me. Public libraries used to be the treasure house of knowledge and information but according to some people in this age of the internet they are of no importance. Of course, many people disagree with this view. In my opinion, state funded libraries certainly have become less important than they used to be; however, I cannot support the argument that they are no longer important. The internet has made state run libraries less important. These days, if you have a device like a smart phone or a computer and an internet connection, you can find up to date information on any topic in a fraction of seconds. Actually, finding information online is a whole lot easier than going to a library and reading voluminous books. Thanks to the search function of the internet, we do not have to turn over pages after pages to find what we want. We just need to type in our query and we get the answer instantly. Needless to say, people who have constant access to the internet no longer visit libraries. On the other hand, public libraries still serve some valuable purpose. To start with, the information on the internet is relatively new whereas libraries have an impressive collection of old manuscripts that are not available online. Also, much of the information online is in English whereas libraries have a huge collection of books written in a wide variety of languages. What’s more, libraries only keep the best reference books on a topic; by contrast, information found online can be unreliable or false because there is no one to check the veracity of data posted online. For this reason, libraries are still the best source of information for research scholars. Libraries also provide a quiet environment where students can read without facing any distractions. In conclusion, there is no denying the fact that public libraries have lost some of their importance. Even so, they are still needed because information stored in a library is always reliable and accurate. Also, libraries have old books and manuscripts that are not available online. Here is a band 7.5 essay on this topic submitted by one of our students. It is often argued that the government-run libraries are not of much use these days. However, there are others who still feel that public libraries are serving a meaningful purpose in the and also shares my own perspective. There are two major reasons for the decreasing popularity of public libraries. Firstly, most public libraries are situated at the city center, and people find travelling to these libraries for borrowing a book quite cumbersome due to their busy schedule and frequent traffic congestion on the roads. Secondly, with the advent of the Internet and the proliferation of the smartphones ample information is available online, so there is no point in spending time in the library. For example, if a student wants to learn about the solar system, he might find a few books related to this topic in the library. On the other hand, if he looks looks it up on the web, he is likely to find abundant resources. Despite the above mentioned reasons, there are several persuasive arguments in favour of the importance of public libraries. To begin with, not everyone can afford an expensive smart phone and the Internet, particularly students from economically disadvantaged families. For instance, my house cleaner’s son often visits the nearby public library in order to get free books, which his father cannot afford to buy with the meagre salary he earns. Furthermore, these libraries represent the history of the city. When a tourist goes to a new place, he can visit a public library to pick up a map of the city or to learn about the history of the place. In conclusion, I believe both arguments are relevant. On balance, in my opinion government-run libraries are becoming obsolete because of the advancement in information technology and the lack of time as the general public finds it time-consuming to go to a library. Even so, libraries are helpful for people who cannot access the internet. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Please note that all band score predictions are approximate. There are some debates about who should design the school curriculum. While some people argue that the teachers should be responsible for this, others are of the opinion that the government should design the curriculum.  I extend my support to the latter view because I believe that the government is the most appropriate authority for taking such vital decisions. Firstly, the central authorities have a better idea about what is needed in the society as they are more aware of the social and economic needs of the people. Furthermore, they conduct studies and hold discussions with subject experts before choosing topics. They make sure that the subjects taught equip students with the skills they need to succeed in the world. For example, nowadays central authorities of many countries have decided to include vocational subjects in the curriculum in order to improve the employability of people. On the other hand, a teacher’s role is to impart knowledge – to deliver the developed curriculum in the most effective way so that each student is able to learn well. Their main aim should be assessing the learning capacity and capability of each student and developing methods and tools to aid them understand and learn so that they can progress well in today’s world.  If teachers decide what curriculum is to be taught there will be too much variation and hence no standardization. This will not be fair to children as their knowledge level cannot be tested and compared if different curriculum exists. In addition, it will hinder government’s goal of providing equal and quality education to all children. Hence, I firmly believe that central authorities should be responsible for designing the curriculum to ensure equal and fair education is given to all and comparable standards exist to meet the education goal of the country.

"The population of the world is an ever increasing number. In most parts of the world, the cities are densely populated. Moreover, this figure keeps on increasing as people move to urban areas for jobs and better opportunities. Overcrowding of the cities leads to multiple problems. The government and civic authorities can help mitigate this problem by taking appropriate steps. Overpopulation poses multiple problems and concerns for a city. Often, people have trouble seeking accommodation, those who do not have sufficient funds resort to staying in shanties and slums. Lack of proper living facilities leads to a variety of health and hygiene problems. There are limited opportunities to find work, so people take up odd jobs in order to earn their daily bread. Transportation is also affected. Transport facilities are designed to cater to the needs of many commuters. Overpopulation is a burden upon transport facilities and this is seen in many cities today; overcrowded trains, buses and multiple traffic jams. Overall overpopulation is a strain on the economy and environment. The government needs to devise methods and ways to combat this issue. Proper civic planning is a must. Taking audits and census on a variety of parameters related to the public is a necessity. Strategies can then be implemented in phases to curb this issue. Providing better jobs and other facilities in parts outside the city is the need of the hour. Passing certain regulations and tabling laws regarding residency and citizenship can help limit overcrowding. For instance, any individual wishing to reside in the city must possess the appropriate documents and reasons for such a move. In conclusion, overpopulation poses a significant threat on the world today. The government and civic officials need to develop solutions or look for alternatives in order to tackle this issue.",8,False,73.56998166925771,298
"With the advent of the World Wide Web, the world has turned into a global village where communication across the globe has become quite easy. However, I can only partially agree with the argument that this has helped people to communicate better because it has also led to some serious issues. If we look at the positive aspects, the internet has made communication faster than what it was three decades ago. Unlike in the olden days, when people used to write letters and wait for replies for a very long span of time, emails have made communications instant. This to and fro messaging system has proved advantageous for various businesses. Secondly, the internet also makes us feel that nobody is far away. For instance, my sister who studies in Ireland is in regular contact with us and we do regular video chats with her. Consequently, my parents are less concerned about her well being and it also gives a feeling that she is close to us. On the contrary, this mode of communication has given rise to various social issues. Some juveniles, these days, are so much engrossed in chatting on social networking websites such as Facebook that they are becoming less sociable. They prefer interacting with unknown strangers over the internet rather than talking to their loved ones around them. Additionally, a few people also get in touch with wrong people and get involved in illegal activities as no sanity check or background check is done on them before they start chatting with them. In conclusion, although internet has made it possible to communicate with people anywhere in the world with just a click of a button, it has given rise to various new issues which can have detrimental effects on a person’s life. Hence, we should be cautious while chatting over the Internet and investigate unknown people before interacting with them.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"While some believe that rewarding those in managerial positions with higher pay packets is appropriate, not everyone agrees with this view. Personally, I am leaning towards the latter position due to negative impacts caused by significant difference in salaries within a company.For one, executive officers should know that higher than sufficient salaries are not necessary. Indeed, the higher the remuneration they receive, the more likely the company to suffer from devoid of financial capability. Furthermore, they often gain powers that money can’t buy. For instance, they often make important decisions over how to make their company thrive. They are also entitled to allocate company’s budget and designate tasks to other workers.  these non-financial entitlements, they should refrain from earning more than reasonable amounts as salaries.Unreasonably high salaries granted to the executives can also afflict other employees.

Accordingly, some may leave the company, and others may go on to strike and demand a pay increase. However, those actions . Therefore, unfair salary systems like this would yield unhealthy working environment for both employers and employees.In conclusion, I oppose to  those in managerial roles with obscene amounts of compensation because it can cost the company its prosperity and discourage other employees .

", organization and companies as well as governments impose restrictions  in work places and public amenities. It has become fashionable in the world today .  I feel that smoking can be harmful, but I don’t think it should be forbidden completely. I would also argue that people should have the  whether or not they should smoke.Allow me to present the three positive sides of smoking. Firstly, smoking certainly helps many people to relax. For some, it even improves concentration. If someone is upset  or they have ,  to smoke to reduce the pressure or tension.  people like to smoke when they are relaxing with friends. Secondly, governments throughout the world make huge profits from taxes on cigarettes.

Thirdly, tobacco industry also employs tens of thousands of people all over the world, particularly in poorer countries such as Zimbabwe or the Philippines. Without cigarettes, these people would have no jobs.Despite these positive  are lots of negative effects to smoking too. Initially, smoking has been proven to be very dangerous for health.  cigarette contains more than 4000 chemical substances, therefore, it  dangerous diseases such as heart attacks, asthma, bronchitis or lung cancer. According to a recent report in Britain close to 3,500 people are killed each year in road accidents and 120,000 are killed by smoking. Furthermore, smoking costs governments millions of dollars because of the large number of people who need treatment in hospitals for smoking-related problems. Moreover, passive smoking is also a major concern today. Recent research shows that non-smokers can suffer from health problems if they spend long periods of time among people who do smoke. In the UK children whose parents are are three times as likely to start smoking themselves .In short, I think the world would be a better place without cigarettes. However, the decision of whether  smoke or not to smoke should be for each individual to make. I suggest that people should not smoke in a room or a place where there are non smokers, however they should be free to smoke elsewhere.",7,False,98.09044585079391,357
"It is true that content whether it is on television or in newspapers is in the hands of editors. They decide what to print or air based on several factors. Most of the time media houses highlight negative news because of its shock value; however, in my opinion, media should give more importance to positive news. Mass media plays a significant role in our day to day lives as it keeps us updated about national and international affairs. However, the credibility of several news stories has been questioned in recent times due to a variety of factors. Firstly, some editors are profit-minded; they modify manipulate the truth and present it in such a way that it remains the talk of the town for a long time by adding gossips and rumours into it. For example, they publish or broadcast whatever they hear about celebrities without checking the facts first despite knowing that this is an unethical practice. Secondly, many articles are politically influenced and oftentimes, the editors are helpless in this case. For example, while launching any new government scheme, they focus only on those aspects of it by which the political party can create its vote bank overlooking public interest. Finally, the selection of news is also influenced by the interests and concerns of the local public. I believe that people are more accustomed to negative news due to their constant exposure to it and un-ethical marketing strategies of mass-media, but this practice / phenomenon has long-term negative consequences. The role of media is to make us aware of the happenings around and their implications on us. If they show better side of any news, people would be more fearless and confident about the surroundings. In addition to that children are vulnerable to negative news; they take it very seriously affecting their psychological health. In conclusion, many factors influence an editor’s decisions while publishing any news. In my opinion, editors should show their commitment to the society by using their discretion while selecting news stories.

"Some people believe that global warming is the most challenging environmental issue that we have nowadays; however, others think deforestation has more destructive effects on earth. This essay will discuss why global warming and deforestation are both harmful for the environment.  On the one hand, global warming has caused a drastic rise in temperature all over the world. It is mainly because of the high / higher amounts of radiation reaching the earth due to the depletion of the ozone layer which is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon -dioxide and chlorofluro carbon. Because of such climatic changes, sea levels are bound to rise. For example, an article published by The Times in 2018 reported icebergs in Antarctica were melting at a higher rate than usual. If, this scenario continues increasing sea levels can cause an entire region to disappear or to be submerged. Moreover, the radiation effects can cause dreadful diseases affecting the skin and eyes. On the other hand, the cutting down of trees on a large scale will affect the quality of air. Trees absorb carbon dioxide which emanates from the burning of fossil fuels and releases oxygen. Thus deforestation can result in high carbon dioxide levels and low oxygen levels which cause damaging effects on the environment. The high CO2 levels can actually contribute to global warming as well. Generally speaking, the effects of deforestation are usually limited to the area that has lost the forest cover. But global warming is a phenomenon which affects the living beings all over the world. If this issue is unresolved catastrophic events such as tsunamis and hurricanes can arise frequently and also make human beings vulnerable to deadly diseases.  In conclusion, deforestation and global warming are both harmful for the environment. While the effects of deforestation are limited to a particular geographical area, global warming has an impact on the whole planet. However, it is hard to say which is the worst because one thing leads to the other.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"In the olden days people only bought what they needed. However, over the last few decades, their purchasing power has increased and now shopping has become the favorite pastime of many people. In my opinion, this development should be discouraged because excessive consumption is bad for both the society and the environment.  The society has become more affluent over the years. Consequently, they now buy just about anything they can find in the market. It does not really bother them whether they actually need the product or not. Shopping has become a hobby and that explains why people constantly upgrade their mobile phones and cars. To take advantage of this compulsive urge to shop, manufacturers release upgraded versions of their gadgets every six months. The changes could be superficial and yet people place their order months in advance.  A disturbing aspect of this trend is that it leads to competition among peers. Mindless consumption also lands people in deep financial difficulty. Credit cards are widely available now and hence people can buy even if they do not have money in the wallet. Unfortunately, when they default on the card payment, they fall into the debt trap.  Another major downside of excessive consumption is that it leads to the production of more garbage. Landfills are already overflowing with products that are still very much usable. This causes land and water pollution. Another disadvantage of this development is that it results in further depletion of resources that have already become scarce. For example, when the demand for furniture increases more trees have to be cut down. Production also requires electricity and this leads to the burning of more fossil fuels. In conclusion, when shopping becomes a hobby it does not benefit anyone. It lands the shopper in financial difficulty and also hurts the environment. Therefore, I believe that this is a negative development and it should be discouraged.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Every individual works very hard to earn a living, and therefore they are unhappy about having to pay a part of their income to the government. Many people are of the opinion that they have the right to enjoy their hard earned money without paying tax. In my opinion, although it may seem to be unfair, tax payment is very essential and plays a significant role in the economic development of the nation. To begin with, the government needs funds to discharge its numerous responsibilities for the development of the country and the betterment of the society. Administration, defense and infrastructure development all come within the purview of these responsibilities. These services are of utmost importance and would eventually prove to be advantageous for the people of the country as this money would return to them in some form of service. Therefore, people are the real beneficiaries when the nation develops and because of this reason they should pay taxes. In addition to this, there is a limit to what an individual can achieve on their own. The government, by contrast, is capable of doing a lot for the country and hence it needs money.  These funds can only be generated by the taxes paid by its citizens. For example, national defense provides security for the people. For defending people, it needs to be ready with the arms and ammunitions. The money for these demands can only be raised by the taxes paid by the citizens from their earnings. Moreover, it is the responsibility of the individual to contribute to the social and economic progress of the country. To conclude, it is true that tax may seem to be burden, but it is the price that we have to pay for building a developed nation.",8,False,50.30128205128205,295
"These days, people are ignorant of the importance of the natural world, and how disturbance in the ecosystem can impact their lives negatively. There are numerous reasons for this ignorant attitude. However, various steps can be taken to deal with this issue. There are many reasons why people tend to neglect the maintenance of the natural world. Firstly, their tight schedule and increased competition at work place force them to neglect everything except work. In other words, after spending 10 to 12 hours a day at work, a person is so tired and has little interest in participating in a discussion about maintaining our natural ecosystem. They would rather watch TV to relax their minds.  Another reason is the lack of knowledge among people about a few detrimental practices which they follow in their day to day life. For example, people are unaware of the negative impacts of plastic bags on the environment. Furthermore, some people are not bothered about the disturbance created in the natural ecosystem as long as they can earn money from their evil practices. However, there are many significant ways to deal with the issue. Firstly, advertisements are the best way to draw public attention to this issue. When people watch TV programs for entertainment, they can be made aware of the significant benefits of maintaining balance in nature with the help of short ads.  In addition to this, authorities should rope in celebrities to promote environmental causes because they are more influential. For instance, Akshay Kumar promotes ban on plastic bags, and a lot of his fans are persuaded not to use plastic bags. Secondly, strict punishment should be awarded for insensitive acts poaching because it will discourage hunters from continuing the practice of killing animals. Hence, disturbance in the food chain can be reduced to a great extent. In conclusion, the hectic schedule and inadequate knowledge among people are the major reasons why people are unable to understand how important it is to maintain the natural world; however, by using the social media effectively and with the implementation of strict policies, people can be encouraged to take care of the natural ecosystem.

"Over the last few years there has been a dramatic increase in the number of homes powered by solar energy. Many factors contribute to this growing popularity of solar power. Energy requirements are growing rapidly due to industrialisation and urbanisation. In order to meet this growing demand it is important to tap into new energy sources. Solar fits the bill perfectly. It is a renewable source. Unlike other energy sources like coal or petroleum, the source of solar energy – the sunlight – is non-perishable. That means as long as the world exists we will be able to harness the power of the sun. Also, unlike conventional energy sources like coal or petrol, solar energy is clean and green. However, solar energy also has some limitations. Although technology has improved, solar energy is still more expensive than conventional energy. The initial cost of installation of solar panels is also quite high. Various other factors such as the lack of a support system for repairs and the difficulty in getting replacements are also hindering large scale adoption of solar power systems. Another issue is the limited availability of sunlight in many parts of the world. There are many countries that do not receive any sunlight during certain periods of the year. They certainly cannot rely on a volatile power source like the sun. To conclude, the growing popularity of solar power can be attributed to the fact that it is clean and renewable.

"Do you agree or disagree? Which types of workers do you think should benefit from early retirement? In the current time, it is considered by many that setting a limit at retirement age is not appropriate or fair to few professions, I am in complete agreement with the above statement as a lot of occupations can use an extended services, however it will be equally beneficial for other professions like army and police to get an early retirement. On one hand, there are jobs which require tremendous amount of experience and expertise, which workers gain over a period of time, and putting an end to their employment because of their age is just unfair to the knowledge and effort put in. For instance, researchers and scientists give away their entire life to their work, and letting them go just because of age is cruel, knowing that the society will benefit from their work. Similarly, teachers should also be allowed to impart their knowledge till the time they can, as in my opinion without which our progress will be much slower. On the other hand, I would like to say that professions like army and police will extensively benefit from an early retirement programme, because of their intense physical strength and schedules required in order to fulfill their duties. Moreover, an early retirement will give them a chance to be with their families which otherwise becomes impossible for them, due to the postings at non family stations.

In the end, I would like to conclude with stating that, there must be an option for early retirement at will for those who need it as per their job profiles, and an opportunity of extended employment for those who would want to work more as age is just a number for few.",7,False,81.16227171077153,321
"Digital games, such as mobile games, Playstation etcetera have become increasingly popular among youngsters these days. Although these are helpful in making children tech savvy which is necessary in this competitive world, these have myriad negative impacts on children. This essay will discuss the problems associated with this excessive usage and then explain some ways to curb these issues. To begin with, there are various disadvantages to playing computer games excessively Firstly, it isolates the children from the real world. They are not only reluctant to go out, meet friends and play with them but also less likely to spend time with their parents. Thus, in the long run, it is detrimental as they will find it difficult to adjust in the real world where co-operation and adjustment with each other are prerequisites. In addition to this, a plethora of health hazards can ensue from this addiction to video gaming. Obesity and vision problems are inevitable side effects of staring at the computer monitor for long hours at a stretch. It is, therefore, quite common to see that such health related problems are prevalent amongst youngsters worldwide.  There are many plausible measures that can be implemented to tackle this situation much earlier in life. One evident method is to encourage children from their formative years to participate in quite a few physically demanding sports so that they will either remain busy with this lifestyle or develop interest in one or two down the lane. Moreover, this can also be done by motivating them to participate in extra-curricular activities or voluntary work with some NGOs. These steps will definitely reduce the amount of time children spend in front of the computer or the mobile phone. Also, playing a sport or working for a charity will help children develop interpersonal skills and get rid of excess body fat.  To conclude, there are umpteen downsides to playing computer games excessively. For example, it leads to social isolation and weight gain. However, by limiting screen time and encouraging children to play a physical sport, parents and teachers can address these issues to a great extent.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children’s development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint  his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students’ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.On top of this,  enables students to learn in an effective way. According to students’ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.In the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students’ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students.",8,False,55.06858974358975,317
"It is observed that the number of credit card users has increased rapidly in recent times. Therefore, it appears to many people that coins and paper money will be replaced by the plastic money in the foreseeable future. In my opinion, the merits and demerits of credit card usage are in the hand of users. In my opinion, the increase in the access to credit cards can be positive or negative depending upon how they are used. To commence with, the prime benefit of using a credit card is that it provides financial back up in emergency cases such as a health scare and job loss. If an individual needs monetary support instantly then the credit card service is a huge relief to them because it provides money without any additional paperwork. For instance, during a medical treatment, if a patient has to go through urgent surgery which requires an exorbitant amount of money then the patient can pay the medical bills by using a credit card. Thus, it is obvious that credit card usage is a positive development. On the contrary, credit card users are often in deficit due to overspending. As the credit card provides instant money to the cardholder, they can purchase products and avail of services which are out of their budget. Eventually, they may end up with a huge debt which needs to be paid on time; otherwise they will have to pay penalties for late payment. Thus, it is evident that credit cards do have a negative impact on people’s finances. To conclude, a credit card is in demand because of its easy and convenient use. In my opinion, access to a credit card can be a positive development as long as one uses it responsibly. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is opined by a few people that physical strength is crucial for winning the tough competition in sports whereas others believe that mental strength plays an equally significant role in achieving success in sports. In my opinion, it is the perfect blend of physical and mental fitness which helps an individual to face the challenges in the game and obtain victory. Physical fitness is extremely important since any outdoor sport involves a lot of running, stretching and quick movements. Hence, a strong and flexible body is an added advantage.  Due to this, most of the sports men engage in rigorous physical activity to make themselves ready to face the opposite team in the game. For example, in most of the sports played at the international level, the selection of individual players representing the country is done based on the physical energy and stamina of the individual.  Even though physical strength has a vital role in success, the mental stability is equally important especially when playing a team game. Understanding and coordination among the individual team players is also required which is possible only if the players have a strong and mature mindset. The strategy to win a game demands persistence, consistent efforts and never say die attitude along with a goal-oriented approach. Research has shown that the cause behind the failure of a team in certain sports like cricket, football and hockey is the lack of team spirit. Due to these reasons, the mental health of the sports person is also taken into consideration when forming a team. In conclusion, I feel that mental strength is as important as physical strength. The sports person should not only work on their physical fitness but also cultivate the right attitude. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"An increasing number of couples around the world are taking the decision not to have kids. In my opinion, childless couples can have a more financially stable life; however, they may face many problems when they reach their retirement age. The foremost benefit of not having children is the availability of disposable income. The cost of raising a child has surged during the last few decades and it has become very difficult to manage the school fees, healthcare costs & other expenses related to kids. Without the responsibility of children, couples can have more financial freedom. A research paper published in the Wall Street Journal reported that American couples without kids had 60% more savings than those who had at least one or more kids to raise. However, there are also a few drawbacks to this trend. The most significant problem is that when the couples grow old, they lack the emotional and financial support. It is very common that the kids support their old parents financially and spend time taking care of them. Such assistance is not available to the people who decide to live their lives without children. It impacts the satisfaction and happiness of these people. For instance, a survey carried out by Harvard University claimed that the Americans living without children are 65% more likely to face depression and anxiety. In conclusion, although the lack of kids can provide an opportunity to have more financial savings, there are negative consequences. Couples without children tend to have less satisfied life after the retirement age because there is nobody to take care of them. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Nowadays, it is not uncommon to notice many shops extending their work hours to meet current market needs. Both advantages and drawbacks are associated with this trend.  On the one hand, stores extending their working hours benefit consumers and the society in many ways. Instead of having to store up foods and other perishable items at home, individuals are able to purchase fresh food and commodities on a daily basis. This provides convenience for the public, especially those who work in night shifts.  Moreover, extra hours of operation can form a competitive commercial market as more stores have overlapping business hours. For example, when two supermarkets both stay open until midnight, customers have accessibility to more products and can compare the available options. It would in turn prevent monopolies and form a healthier economic network. Additionally, with longer opening hours, more employees need to be hired to cope with the increased workload. Such growing demand for labor would help a country’s employment situation and benefit household financial status, which further lead to national economic growth.  On the flip side, this prevalence can trigger side effects on domestic relationships. Since shop assistants are allocated longer work hours, they have less time to spend with their spouse and children and this can lead to problems at home. For example, children who have both parents working are more likely to spend their time with internet and television. These kids are easily influenced by media. Lack of supervision may also lead to disruptive behaviour in children. To conclude, after analysing both sides of the argument it is not hard to see that when shops remain open for longer hours, it has both positive and negative effects on the society.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In the Third World, children are usually sent to factories for laborious work. Many people believe that it is merely exploitation, while others think it is a good opportunity for them to  life experience. In any case, children have their right to live and study in peaceful conditions. Therefore, using them as workforce is considered an unacceptable action.First of all, children are not workers. They have just learned about the vast world and do not have any experience or concept of working. Since these innocent children are naive and , they can be easily cheated and exploited. There are many examples of this in poor nations. Because using children is cheap and  to control, many enterprises hire them and don’t pay them much. Although the government in these countries has tried its best, this kind of taking advantage of children cannot be eliminated. Moreover, children do not need such thing as ‘valuable work experience’ that is supposedly ‘important for learning and taking responsibility’. The brief responsibility of children is learning. They are not old enough to understand what working experiences are. Nevertheless, they can help parents do chores or housework. This will be a much better way for them to become more responsible for . In addition, childhood is one of the most remarkable memories and must not be taken away by forcing them to work.In conclusion, since all children are the great concern of parent and society, they should be allowed to enjoy life and  rather than  to work. Hence, one must ponder what view is actually appropriate for the sake of the children.",6,False,75.57324554977657,263
"The primary role of the state is to protect its citizens from different types of threat. Therefore, some people argue that the government should direct much of its financial resources to the defense sector and cut down the spending on social welfare. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, a country has to spend on both social welfare and defense.   There is no denying the fact that a powerful military can ensure the safety of the citizens and maintain peace in a country. A strong military deters aggressive neighbours or terrorists from attacking a country and thereby prevents the loss of innocent lives and property. Moreover, in some countries, military can help with law enforcement and promote political stability by maintaining the sovereignty of the government. Therefore, it is crucial for a government to allocate a sufficient amount of funding to the defense sector.  However, the spending on military cannot be at the expense of social spending because the social welfare is as critical as military might for a country to thrive. The government is responsible to ensure that all the people can satisfy their basic human needs such as food, shelter and health care. By providing welfare for the neediest members of the society through various schemes, the state can improve their living standards and make its people happy and contented.  If there were no social benefit programs such as retirement schemes, disability benefits or subsidized housing, the vulnerable sections of the society would suffer. This can lead to resentment among the disadvantaged sections of the society and social uprising against the authorities. Moreover, citizens are entitled to receive benefits because they pay taxes to the government. Nowadays, only those countries which put great importance on social security can prosper. For example, Canada is a thriving country whose citizens enjoy almost free healthcare.  In conclusion, the state should give as much importance to the welfare of the citizens as to their safety and it will do more harm than good if it reduces the spending on social welfare for increasing military expenditure.

"There is no doubt that education and the learning process has changed since the introduction of computers: The search for information has become easier and amusing, and connectivity has expedited the data availability. Though  systems have made computers more intelligent, they have not yet become a substitute of the human interaction in the learning process. In my opinion what can be expected is a change of the teachers’ role, but not their disappearance from the classroom.Nobody can argue with the fact that the acquisition of knowledge is more fun and easier with computers. The mere activity of touching and exploring this device constitutes an enjoyable task for a child. This, accompanied by the relaxing attitude and software interactivity, usually contributes to a better grasping of new knowledge. At a higher educational level the availability of digital books, simulators and other academic materials provide the student with an ever accessible source of information, that otherwise would not be at hand.But, besides the increasing complexity and behavior of intelligent software, which is usually embedded in the academic digital material, the need for human interaction in the learning process will always be present, at least in the foreseeable future. There is the necessity for a human being to be able to determine what the  needs of each individual are. The expertise of a teacher in how to explain and adapt complex concepts to different individuals can hardly be mimicked by a computer, no matter how sophisticated its software is.As computers are becoming a common tool for teaching, teachers should be more aware of their role as guides in the acquisition of knowledge rather than transmitters of facts. They have to be open minded to the changes that are taking , keep updated and serve as problem solvers in the learning process, thus allowing students to discover the  for themselves.To summarize, in my personal view, teachers play and will continue to play an important role in the classroom, especially at the primary level.

"An essential problem of the 21st century is world pollution. Currently the environment is so contaminated that urgent measures should be taken. A single individual cannot be blamed for the world pollution, however every person should take care of his or her habitat. In addition, it is vital that environmental issues are treated internationally.Lately, many presentations, conferences and international summits are held to deal with waste treatment, recycling, and soil and water contamination.  joint efforts and consolidation can only help in the mutual war  the ongoing environmental disaster.

If we do not  that our planet is our home, we will never be able to take  care of it. We have to contribute every day to the preservation of nature and environment. For example, always remember to save energy by switching off lamps, computers and everything that we do not use. Our next obligation is to separate waste and throw bulk only in the designated areas. Driving vehicles can also be environment friendly. For example, we have to avoid accelerating the engines too rapidly or using the air conditioning in the country, where it would be better to save energy and simply open the windows.To sum up, environmental problems should be handled by local and international authorities as well as individuals.

"Many small business entities are struggling to survive in the competition with supermarkets, which are expanding their domination in local communities. It is believed that the demise of local businesses can cause economic downturn in these areas. I partly agree with this idea.  There is a growing concern about the probability of supermarkets destroying local economies. Small local stores cannot offer cheaper prices than supermarkets. Big marts purchase products in bulk, which enables them to offer competitive prices. Small businesses run by just the owner or a few employees cannot offer the same prices or customer care and will eventually lose their market share. The impact the discontinuance of local businesses has on the local economies is so immense that it leads to a long-term economic recession in local communities.  Contrary to this concern, large businesses can benefit local communities in many ways. First, a host of local people can have more opportunities to participate in economic activities. One chain of supermarket needs a number of employees to operate stores in the chain and the number of stores in the chain exceeds the number of employees at local businesses. Additionally, they need more workers to be allocated for distribution and operation. Second, the conglomerate can contribute to the improvement of welfare in local areas. Most companies capitalize on investment in the local area as their marketing strategy and residents can gain benefits from it. This investment can be exhibitions, concerts or support for local sport team.  In conclusion, some people are apprehensive about the future of local economy due to the entry of supermarkets. I contend that despite the possibility of reduction in the number of small businesses, local communities can garner more benefits from big chains which offer employment opportunities and investment into welfare.

"Some people think that the things that truly matter in life are free or cannot be bought with money. I completely agree with this view. Money can only buy material comforts. While these are also important in life, in my opinion, they are not the most important things. I have seen many poor people who lead happy and content lives in spite of their poverty. I have also seen many rich people who lead miserable lives in spite of having all the money in the world. If money could buy happiness, the rich must be the happiest in the world. The reality, however, is different. In my opinion, the most important things in life are love and friendship and neither can be bought with money. Parents’ love, for example, is the biggest gift a person receives in their lifetime and it is free. You may be the poorest person in the world but that will not stop your parents from loving you. Relationships with our family and friends are actually the things that keep us going and they are free. Just because you are poor it does not mean that you cannot be in a meaningful relationship. In fact, if you have a nice character and a kind personality, you will have no dearth of friends. By contrast, a rich person with an arrogant personality and a bossy attitude may be lonely in life because no one wants to be with them. To conclude, while it is true that money can buy many things, truly important things in life like love and relationships are actually free and cannot be bought.",9,False,50.59312327062912,270
"It is considered that richness plays a vital role in charity. Though it is true that donations come only from surplus incomes, I can only partially agree with this because there are many people who refuse to support in spite of being wealthy.  Undoubtedly, charitable attitude arises only when people have disposable incomes. In other words, people offer donation from the excess amount they have after their monthly expenses. If people struggle for their survival, it is highly impossible for them to help fellow humans. Moreover, the thought of offering help comes only when people are self-sufficient so that they can lead a comfortable life even after helping others. To illustrate, there is a group in my organisation which collects money/funds on a monthly basis from peers and friends. The majority of them earn well and that is why they allocate some amount from their salary to help the needy. However, in my view, alongside richness, the right mindset is equally important to help others. There are many people who are affluent yet do not come forward to donate. Because their perception is that it is the responsibility of the government to take care of the needy and not them. Many actors and sports people, for example, are rich but only a few turn out to be philanthropic. Rest of them does not bother about the welfare of their nation or people. So, it is imperative that without the willingness to give, charity does not happen. In summary, even though wealth plays a significant role in philanthropy, it is not the only factor which can be considered for helping others. In my opinion, if people do not have the desire to aid others, wealth is of no use. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"The scarcity of houses is becoming a serious issue in many countries. The changing family structure and the explosion of population seem to be at the root of this problem. However, some workable solutions which can ameliorate the situation exist. The biggest factor which causes the shortage of houses is the burgeoning population. The accelerating birth rate and the limited availability of land have made it difficult / challenging to provide housing for all the people. Another factor which aggravates the problem of housing is the increasing trend of nuclear families. While children used to live with their parents as well as grandparents in the past, today’s children prefer to live alone either to maintain their privacy or to fulfill work and study related commitments. This means more houses are required to accommodate more families. On the bright side, there are solutions to this problem. The government should enact new laws that help in effective utilisation of available land for housing. For example, the government should make legislations to force citizens to make use of underground space. For instance, garage or storeroom which does not need much lightening can be built in the basement. The land saved thus can be provided to other homeless people. Likewise, people should be encouraged to reside in high rise buildings of closely knitted apartments since these can house more people in a relatively smaller piece of land. In conclusion, housing problems are caused by the growing population and the increase in the number of nuclear families. However, the government can mitigate this problem by encouraging the use of underground spaces and the construction of skyscrapers.",8,False,69.2487661169989,270
"Currently the modern world faces a variety of challenges like terrorism and population explosion. Some believe increasing population is the most important challenge of all and I agree with this opinion and substantiate it in the following paragraphs. The tremendous improvement in the field of medicine has considerably increased longevity/ lifespans. Effective treatments have been discovered for the majority of dreadful diseases. For example, small pox which is a fatal disease has been completely eradicated with vaccination. Additionally, green revolution which took place in the field of agriculture lead to exponential increase in the production of food grains. The food had become more affordable and is being distributed to the poor and the needy. The deaths due to starvation and malnutrition which were rampant in the past have reduced.  The rise in the population is the root cause of diverse problems such as climate change which are faced by the humans. Deforestation is mainly caused by encroachment of forest land to create residential areas. Most of the countries are losing forest land to the constructions to facilitate infrastructure needs of the people. Poverty, another challenging evil of the society, also results from the current demographic trends. Since the resources are limited, the distribution of them to more citizens is immensely difficult. Providing employement to all citizens is almost immposible for any government. To conclude, the practice of modern medicine increased the survival of humans contributing to a paradigm shift in demographics and uncontrolled population growth.

"Many leaders around the world believe that improving a country’s economy will bring developments in many other aspects of a country. However, some people point out that focusing too much on financial prosperity has caused traditional values to be forgotten. Although I agree with their view to some extent, I believe that the benefits brought by a good economy far outweigh its drawbacks.  Admittedly, there are a few downsides to placing too much importance on economic growth. Striving for the financial gain can cause citizens to become money oriented and more materialistic. People overindulge in luxuries and eventually, traditional societal values such as value of moderation rather than excess are lost. Happiness will be defined by one’s material possessions and children will think that everything can be bought with money. Moreover, parents are so busy working for money that they overlook the importance of family and the value of a close knit family is often forgotten as a consequence.  On the other hand, a financially stable country has many advantages over a poor nation. A healthy economy means better job opportunities, high employment rates and higher income for the citizens. An economically strong government can invest in the country’s infrastructures such as schools, hospitals and transport networks resulting in more educated and healthier citizens who enjoy higher living standards. This can lead to a significant reduction in many social and health problems such as illiteracy, crimes and poverty related diseases that are faced by countries with financial limitations. Moreover, it is generally true that the happiest countries in the world are the ones that are doing financially well such as Norway and Denmark.  In conclusion, I believe that every country needs to work towards financial development as it brings many advantages for its nationals.

"According to some people companies should prefer innovative and independent workers when selecting employees. On the other hand, others think that team workers should be given preference instead of those who can work independently. In my opinion, a company needs both types of people for optimal growth.  Those, who are in favour of creative and independent workers, claim that such employees bring in new ideas and develop new technological products and apps. This leads to an increase in the sales as well as improve the reputation of the company. Since the advent of new age technologies, a brilliant idea can help a company make a fortune. Hence, innovative employees who can work without supervision are an asset for any organization.  However, some people believe that teamwork is the key to the success of a company. They hold the view that working together stimulates brainstorming. When people with different skills, point of views and experiences work together, they can create great innovations. Teamwork and the ability to follow instructions mean that employees learn to cope with challenges and remain disciplined in every situation. Moreover, they can compensate for each other’s weaknesses and develop a problem solving attitude. All of these are highly beneficial for a company or a business to be successful. For instance, a recent research showed that 80% of the successful businesses had more employees who were better team workers than independent workers. In conclusion, I believe that both kinds of workers are needed in a company. When recruiting staff, employers should look for both skills – the ability to work with others as well as the ability to work independently in some situations. This can make the companies look more dynamic and lead to economic growth. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Nowadays, skin whitening products are incredibly popular across the world and provide huge profits for the companies involved in their sale. This is because of media that shows the white skin as ideal for all. Certainly, this trend has adverse effects on individuals and the society. To commence with, one of the predominant reasons why people use whitening products is media influence. To illustrate, media shows that white skinned people are more successful and beautiful than the ones who have dark skin. Keeping this impression in mind, people use different cosmetic products to enhance their skin color. In addition, white skin color is linked with status. Since the high standard people always stay inside without much exposure to the sun, they have clean and bright skin. Therefore, many people use whitening creams to show-off. Of course, these products have negative effects on people’s health. For instance, companies mix chemicals in these products and they are harmful to the skin. A recent study has shown that the ingredients of these products are carcinogenic and may cause cancer if applied regularly. There are detrimental effects on the society as well. People with darker skin believe that white is better than black. Owing to this, they try to avoid being part of social events; as a result, they suffer from depression and stress. To conclude, it is indeed a fact that whitening products have a profitable market. Media influence is one of the major factors contributing to this trend.

It has been observed that psychologically challenged people are less likely to be accepted by the public and physical disabilities are treated with more empathy than mental illness. I completely agree with this viewpoint and I will explain the reasons in this essay. Scientific research shows that a few psychological disorders manifest at the later stage of life. Moreover, sometimes a person with a family history of mental illness or a traumatic experience is usually the one who becomes the victim of these types of illness. Although these diseases are rare, the society does not accept them because patients behave unreasonably in such cases. For example, people who suffer from split personality disorder often display different characters at the same time in unpredictable ways. In such situations, it is difficult to control them by regulating their behaviors. Hence, society is disrespectful to these people. On the other hand, patients who have physiological illness are accepted by the society because these diseases can be cured by medications or therapies. The predominant factor is that they can communicate with patients as they are mentally stable whereas the connection cannot be established with mentally-ill patients. Consequently, many families abandon mentally unstable people.  To recapitulate, any illness related to health whether physical or psychological are harmful and they should be treated with medication and family support. However, the society only shows concern for physically ill people as mentally ill patients are difficult to deal with and behave unpredictably. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Today many students find it difficult to pay attention in the class. Outdated teaching methods and the distractions caused by technology are the main reasons for this. There are a number of solutions which can be implemented to deal with children who lack attention. Firstly, the most important reason for the lack of concentration at school is the new world of entertainment such as smart phones, video games and social media. Now children spend most of their time at home playing video games and using social networking sites and this affects their life negatively. Therefore, when they are at school they think of these things and their concentration is affected. Secondly, children are now bored with the old technique of teaching. Furthermore, they find it less interesting, so automatically their attention gets distracted. Moreover, this affects their studies and reflects in their result. There are effective solutions for these problems. One way to tackle this is to make classroom teaching more interesting. For example, technological innovations can be used in the classroom. To illustrate, with the help of power point presentations schools can make teaching more interesting. For instance, showing animated images and visual effects will help to get children excited about their lessons. Another method of dealing with children is to focus less on theoretical studies and more on practical studies. For example, if a teacher wants to teach about the manufacturing process of a product, they should consider taking the students to a manufacturing plant. This will help them to learn faster and with interest. In conclusion, using technology and new ways of teaching can help to solve the problem of attention and concentration in children.",7,False,74.79433465867504,278
"Globalization is such a commonly used term in the  century. It simply means that the world has become integrated economically, socially, politically and culturally through the advances of technology, transportation and communication. It is undeniable that globalization has resulted in both positive and negative effects which must be addressed accordingly.To begin with, globalization has contributed to the world’s economies in many beneficial ways. The advances in science and technology have allowed businesses to easily cross over territorial boundary lines. Consequently, companies tend to become more productive and competitive thereby raising the quality of goods, services and the world’s living standard.Secondly, several companies from the more developed countries have already ventured to establish foreign operations or branches to take advantage of the low cost of labor in the poorer countries. This kind of business activity will provide more influx of cash or investment funds into the less developed countries.However, one cannot deny the negative effects which  derived from globalization. One crucial social aspect is the risk and danger of epidemic diseases which can easily be spread as the transportation becomes easier and faster in today’s advanced society. This is evidenced in the recent birds flu disease which has infected most Asian countries over a short period of time.As large corporations invest or take over many offshore businesses, a modern form of colonization will also evolve which may pose certain power pressure on the local governments of the less developed countries. Unemployment rates in the more developed regions such as Europe may also escalate as corporations choose to outsource to the cheaper work force from Asian countries.In conclusion.  to reiterate that globalization is inevitable and we must urge individuals, companies and governments to use a more balanced approach by taking the appropriate steps to deal with matters relating to the financial or economical gains verses the social, political or ecological concerns of the world.",8,False,91.25708808394712,312
"Nowadays, people are increasingly purchasing more and more products that they do not necessarily want. This essay will provide reasons why this is happening and argue why it will have a negative effect on people and community in general. To begin with, there are different reasons for people to purchase things that they do not need. Firstly, they are very rich and want to show their wealth by all means. This is because there might a race amongst rich people to show off how much money they have. For example, in Sudan, many rich people buy things that they might never use for staggering prices just because one of them bought it. As a result, they waste their money in obsolete and useless products. Furthermore, it might happen because of their ignorance of the kinds and uses of such products. So, there are different reasons for people to buy products that they do not need. Unfortunately, this kind of habits will negatively affect people and community. They will haemorrhage huge amount of money each time they buy such products. This will consequently lead to increase rate of poverty amongst the population. In addition, such spending will result in the accumulation of waste products in neighbourhoods. This could happen because people might throw away these unneeded products. For instance, in 2016, it was reported that 25% of the waste products in Saudi Arabic were new and unused at all. As a result, the cost of removing such products from neighbourhoods will increase significantly. To sum up, it is evident why people purchase such useless products. This trend will obviously have negative effects on people and community.",7,False,66.0568766066838,273
"It is not uncommon to see children playing with toys in most of their free time. Owing to this, some parents purchase a large number of toys for their offspring to play with. This situation has both merits and demerits and this essay will discuss them in detail. Admittedly, there are a few benefits for children if they have a large number of toys. First and foremost is that toys assist children in their overall development, both physically and mentally. Every toy is manufactured to satisfy a special need of children. For example, building blocks, alphabets games, doctor’s kit etcetera help children to develop intellectual skills. For instance, studies have shown that children who play with toys are smarter than those who do not have many toys.   Additionally, having many toys ensures that they are less likely to get bored. This condition also prevents children from getting involved in wrong activities which is possible if kids go out to play and befriend strangers during their leisure time. Since youngsters are highly vulnerable, they are easily swayed by the company of some wrong doers. Nevertheless, this phenomenon has significant cons. Firstly, children who have numerous toys tend to become stubborn. This is because if the young one’s every desire for toys always gets fulfilled by their guardian, then they will become demanding which is not good for their holistic development. Sometimes they become disrespectful and do not value their parents’ hard earned money. Furthermore, having lots of toys means they have fewer opportunities for social interaction. Since children are always busy playing with toys, they fail to interact with others. This reduces their chances of developing and honing interpersonal skills which are imperative to have when adults step into the workplace. To conclude, even though possessing numerous toys is advantageous during the initial period of children’s lives and reduces the risk of them going astray under the influence of outsiders, this has myriad drawbacks which should be considered beforehand as in the long run the negatives impacts will definitely eclipse the positive ones.

"Advancements in technology, effective modes of communication, and modernization have enabled us to live in a much more globalized way these days. We now often label ourselves as global citizens. Some people feel it is not advantageous. I believe globalization has more positive developments than negative ones. The prime advantage of globalization is the unification of diverse countries to deal with humanitarian crises. Nations can come together to fight for a common cause. One relevant example here is the issue of environmental damage. Global warming, pollution and depletion of natural resources cannot be mitigated by the efforts of a single or of a few nations. On the other hand, if countries come together they can form a globalized body and agree upon strict environmental regulations. Also, in the cases of food crises or natural calamities, international assistance can save many lives. For example, the United Nations provide aid to less privileged countries in Africa. Another advantage of globalization is the wide-ranging benefits to a consumer. A local citizen can enjoy products from a global market. For example, smartphone manufacturers Apple and Samsung have many customers in India.  On the flip side, there is a fear of losing regional identity and integrity. Globalization seems to influence developing and third world countries to adopt western culture of the developed world. The more globalized we are, the greater our tendency to buy internationally acclaimed products. This leads to the closure of several local businesses. For example, the facilitation of global trade has led to the proliferation of Chinese products in India. This has diverted the profits from local Indian entrepreneurs to Chinese companies. Moreover, globalization poses a threat to indigenous languages and traditions. In summary, I feel that globalization fosters better cooperation and bonding amongst different territories. It also enables people to bind together. The idea of a global family makes people more empathetic and encourages them to lend a helping hand to the needy. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to some people, it is better to work for the same establishment throughout their career, while others opine that changing jobs frequently is more beneficial. I believe that working in the same enterprise is better than switching jobs every few years as it not only helps an employee to achieve good career progress but also guarantees them financial stability. On the one hand, people who change jobs frequently acquire a diverse set of skills. This will definitely help them in many ways. Also, people who job hop are less likely to experience work related boredom. On the flip side, however, this may seriously hinder their career prospects. They are less likely to receive a promotion or rise. Their chances of acquiring domain expertise are also slim.  By contrast, staying in the same job is more beneficial. To start with, people who work for the same organization for their entire working life have significantly higher chances of getting a promotion and raise. They could even be promoted to managerial positions. In addition, the years or decades of experience they have working in the same field definitely give them an edge over those who switch careers frequently. Another advantage of staying with the same company is that it allows employees to have better work life balance. They do not have to worry about frequent transfers. Also the comfort level that they develop with their colleagues after working with them for years make the workplace more pleasant and less stressful for them.  To sum up, changing jobs frequently certainly has some advantages. However, in my opinion, this practice can seriously hinder one’s chances of gaining promotion. By contrast, working with the same organisation ensures much better career prospects and work life balance.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some people contend that mixed ability classes are more beneficial for children’s development than streaming them on the basis of judgement about their academic abilities. However, from my perspective, I disagree with this contention.Admittedly, mixed ability classes provide a better environment for children’s all-round development. In such classes, children with different abilities study together and in turn they can learn from one another. From example, a student, who is good at academic study but weak in dancing or painting, can learn how to dance or paint  his peers. In this sense, mixed ability classes allow students to develop their abilities in different subjects instead of only academic abilities.Despite the argument above, I believe streaming students brings more benefits to teachers and students. As for teachers, separating children with better academic abilities from others facilitates effective teaching. This practice helps teachers to control their students more conveniently and easily. Compared with mixed ability in which teacher should consider students’ differences when they are using teaching methodologies, streaming makes this situation simpler. To be more specific, students are at the same level of academic ability in a class, and in turn teachers can use the same methodologies for them all. In this way, the narrower the spread of ability in the class, the more convenient the teaching can be.On top of this,  enables students to learn in an effective way. According to students’ different abilities, they are taught in different ways that are more suitable for them. In the top streams, students use more difficult materials, therefore, they can learn more. In sharp contrast, teachers can explain the material more slowly to those in bottom streams. Under this circumstance, students with different academic abilities can study effectively and efficiently.In the final analysis, mixed ability classes are beneficial for students’ versatile development, but in my opinion, segregating students based on different academic ability is better for both teachers and students.",8,False,55.06858974358975,317
"The world is now more global than before as there is increased trade and culture exchange. This essay will outline the advantages and drawbacks of this development, and In (remove the capital letter) my opinion, the benefits are more important. On the one hand, it is often thought by some that allowing nations to interact with one another brings many disadvantages. Firstly, immigrants find it difficult to adapt to their new environment. Many people who are working or studying in other countries find it challenging to interact with locals because of the language barrier and feel isolated. Moreover, the weather is another challenge. Secondly, international students face racism. For example, a recent survey by California University found that over 30% of students from other countries are bullied daily because of their colour. On the other hand, others believe that there are numerous benefits for countries becoming global, and I agree. First of these is the increase in revenue. As companies establish branches in many different parts of the world, supplying goods and services, they create numerous job opportunities. This reduces the unemployment rate and increases the living standards of people all over the world. The growing trade relations between countries also help to establish peace in the world. In addition to this, the increased interaction among people of diverse cultures has made them more tolerant of differences. To conclude, I believe that globalization is beneficial because the increasing interaction among various countries allows for economic growth and closer relationships despite the challenges of cultural differences and climate conditions.

"Some people opine that using the computer every day is largely disadvantageous for children although it might provide some benefits. I agree with this view. To start with the negative effects, children normally play and engage in various kinds of physical activity which boost their physical and psychological health. However, nowadays, they are sitting in front of the computer for hours on end. This behavior is an aberration and seriously hinders their normal physical development. Secondly, too much exposure to computer games and other online content can affect the development of life-skills in children. For example, children who spend a lot of time on the computer may fail to develop meaningful relationships with their peers and even those within the family. Consequently, many of them grow up into introverts lacking social skills and self confidence. In addition, children are naïve and easily fall prey to cyber fraud. For instance, some children who played the “Blue Whale” game committed suicide because they felt defeated and blackmailed. The computer also hurts their ability to do simple calculations or memorize spellings.  Of course, there are also some advantages to using the computer. Computers are excellent learning aids and help children with their studies. With the help of the computer and the internet, children can easily complete their assignments. The computer can also be used to acquire new skills. For example, children can learn a new language or programming skills online. They can also make friends with people from around the world. In conclusion, there are certainly some benefits to using the computer. However, excessive and regular use of the computer can do more harm than good because during their growing up years children are supposed to spend more time in the real world than in the virtual world.

"Some people believe that internet access creates problems. There are several possible reasons why it can happen.Firstly, some data may be unverifiable. For example, they search for a data, there would be lots of choices that would appear on the screen. They would not be sure if the information they are reading is accurate. Some sources may even have outdated . Secondly, some sites may be unreliable. For instance, people sign up on one site that sells goods online. The goods would be paid for by a credit card, but the purchaser would not receive anything. And finally, not everything is available through the net. When my friend had tried to research for some pictures of 18th century paintings, he did not find any results. Then he was told by his teacher that they would only be available in the library.Others believe that the Internet is very useful and these are the justifications. Firstly, it is hard to get the same data, that is available through the Internet by other means. For example, if the directory information could not give me the accurate address and contact number of a place I  to visit, I normally check that information on the Internet. In just one click, I would get all the details of that  company. Secondly, research becomes more comprehensive. For instance, I do not have to buy lots of reading materials to complete my research. Most of the needed information can be found if I have Internet access. And finally, data is easily compared and contrasted.  researched a study about overweight children a decade ago and at presentwas able to finish his research in just one day, as compared to a week if he would not use the Internet.In conclusion, let me reiterate that the Internet plays a big role in our life, because it makes data retrieval and comparison easier.",7,False,80.80534560180557,310
"Nowadays, in most cities across the globe, many people opt to live in big apartment buildings. In my opinion, this type of accommodation has far more benefits than drawbacks. Let me explain in more detail. To begin with, one of the main advantages of big apartment buildings is that they help in lowering housing prices. As more and more people move to cities for a better life, city authorities will struggle to accommodate them if they don’t build large apartment buildings. For instance, the Japanese city of Tokyo tackled the problem of high housing prices by building big apartment buildings. As a result, Tokyo has now one of the cheapest housing prices in the world. All in all, big apartment buildings help stabilize the housing markets. Another benefit of big apartment buildings is that they help people come together as communities. It is very easy for them to socialize and make friends as they live closer to each other. For example, in 2010, a survey which was conducted in Australia found that people who live in apartment buildings are more sociable than those who live in houses and other types of accommodation.  Also they experience less loneliness than people living in standalone houses. In addition, apartments are safer and have a lot of amenities that houses do not have. For example, they may have club houses, swimming pools and gyms. To sum up, I strongly believe that big apartment buildings have more benefits than drawbacks. They make housing more affordable and bring people together.",8,False,55.981617834828654,253
"In recent years, the usage of internet on the electronic gadgets has become quite popular among readers. Some people believe that the increasing use of the internet has made regular books redundant. However, others insist that the conventional method of reading paper books is the optimum way of learning and cannot be replaced by the internet or other sources. In my point of view, we will see more digitalization of the print media in the near future and the majority of the population will switch to electronic books and content. First of all, the growing usage of mobiles and laptops among the youngsters has changed the way of reading and studying. A plethora of books and magazines are available on the internet free of cost. As a result of this, many universities and schools now have decided to allow students to use the internet in the classrooms and libraries. Besides that, eBooks are environment friendly as they eliminate the need to cut down trees for the production of paper books. Moreover, eBooks are easy to share as no parcels are required to deliver them from one place to another. On the other hand, the traditional method of reading has its own benefits.Though books are heavy to carry and require a lot of care, readers can easily make notes and highlight keywords. Internet users are not able to do this. In addition to that, kids and school students learn faster by reading books rather than e-books. Books don’t need electricity and other required electric set ups to start reading. A recent report published in the UK elaborate that the people who read books possess better memory than those who use the internet. To conclude, popularity of the internet reading has significantly increased among the readers. This changing trend has been accepted mostly by youngsters, while there are still many readers who believe in the conventional method of reading books. In my opinion, it is absolutely necessary to go with the flow as digital versions of books are the future as they are reliable, cost efficient and environment friendly.",8,False,71.5185745363735,347
"While it is irrefutable that engaging in social work is a great way to give back to the society, some people do not support this. Some believe that adolescents / juveniles should be made to work for free, while there are others who insist that involving youngsters in such work will waste their time and can also distract them from their studies. While I agree with the latter view, this essay, however, shall elaborate on / discuss both the opinions.  Spending time on welfare projects can have an adverse effect on children’s future. They will have to invest time on social projects from their hectic work schedule and this will reduce the time available for studies. For instance, a student after coming from the school will have to engage in the voluntary work, leaving behind their class/homework. Furthermore, if children have to engage in community service during their leisure time, they will not have time to play sports or games. Thus engaging in social work can prove to be detrimental for young people. In contrast, people who support youngsters’ involvement in social work are of the view that it will inculcate humanitarian values in children and make them much more responsible.  Also, youngsters have a lot of strength and ideas to contribute and it can be beneficial for both. In other words, younger people can perform tasks which require an excessive amount of physical effort which seniors may not be able to perform. To conclude, even though doing unpaid jobs allows young people to learn about social commitment, it is always best for the children to spend much of their time on their education and their physical fitness in order to prepare themselves for their future.

"In recent times, an increasingly large number of people are opting to watch movies in their leisure time because movies provide entertainment and relaxation. In my opinion, it is a positive trend, as long as it is done in moderation. To begin with, watching movies is considered by many as the perfect way to unwind after a hard day at work. Elaborating further, most of the people these days have a hectic schedule and stressful jobs, and they look forward to the ways through which they can relax their mind and body. In their opinion, movies not only entertain them but also help them forget their tensions and worries. Besides this, there are no physical or mental efforts required to watch movies which again makes them the most preferred choice since the majority of the jobs nowadays are challenging and require a lot of efforts. In my view, watching movies is definitely a good idea as it gives people the much-needed break from their regular strenuous routine. What’s more, many people watch movies with their family and friends, making it a social activity. However, one should not spend all their free time watching movies. They need to take out some time for doing exercise as well. Since many people spend most of their time to watch movies they are left with no time to exercise and thus develop health problems at a young age. To recapitulate, watching movies in one’s free time has gained popularity in recent times because people consider it as the perfect way to relax. I believe that it is a positive development which helps people to socialize and gives them a break from their monotonous schedule.

"According to some people spending a lot of money on marriage parties is a must. Others insist that lavish celebrations are a waste of money and resources. Both views will be discussed in this essay; however, in my opinion, it does not make much sense to spend a lot of money on celebrations. Celebrations make our lives more interesting. Also, lavish parties are an opportunity to show off our wealth. Actually, this is the reason many people choose to spend inordinate amounts of money on weddings. They believe that throwing a lavish wedding party will easily elevate their social standing. My uncle, for example, makes it a point to celebrate the weddings of his children in a lavish manner. He believes that those parties will earn him the respect of his friends and acquaintances. On the other hand, there is a downside to throwing large wedding parties. Oftentimes families borrow money to celebrate the wedding of their son or daughter in a grand style. They may have seen their neighbour hold an expensive party on the occasion of his daughter’s marriage. Now, they feel compelled to have an even bigger party. This is not exactly a problem if they can afford it but that is not always the case. Many families fall into the debt trap in their desperation to hold a grand wedding that their friends will remember for good. Also, large parties often lead to the wastage of enormous amounts of foods and beverages. Personally, I believe that instead of throwing ridiculously expensive parties, people should organize more intimate and simpler celebrations. Wedding celebrations are an opportunity to share our joy with our friends and relatives and small parties serve the purpose very well. Actually, spending large amounts on parties is a sign of vanity. And if this money is borrowed it is nothing but stupidity. Instead, people who truly want an unforgettable wedding should donate a sum of money to the disadvantaged sections of the society on this occasion. This way they can ensure that their celebrations bring joy to a lot of people who need it desperately. To conclude, wedding celebrations are important because in most people’s lives they occur only once; however, it is foolish to spend astronomical amounts of money on these celebrations. Instead, people who have excess money should consider donating some to the poor and the needy. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The invention of the World Wide Web by Tim Bernese proved to be a turning point in the world of technology. It has opened various channels where users can share their information in a way that was not possible earlier. On the one hand this has made our lives easier but on the other hand it has also brought along several threats such as cyber crimes and cyber bullying. This essay will first discuss how the internet silently puts us at the risk of cyber crime and then suggest some solutions / measures to tackle these issues. There are certain novel crimes that spread through social media platforms. Various types of cyber violation such as frauds, online money laundering and certain forms of malwares which intend to steal a user’s private data are on the rise now. Because of the anonymity offered by the platform social media has become the paradise of hate mongers. They target other users and hurl abuses at them sitting behind their screen. This is nothing but cyber bullying. Teenagers are the most vulnerable targets of the internet. Nowadays, adult content which can be really harmful for them is easily available on the internet. However, these issues can be solved easily by implementing strict laws which intend to penalize the culprit. Many new users are not aware of the rules made by the government for these problems. Hence the government should run some kind of awareness sessions to ensure that people are aware of cyber laws and their right to privacy and protection. For instance, the Nigerian government in the year 2017 ran a successful campaign about cyber threats such as viruses and malware. This led to a dramatic reduction of data breaches. Also educating the young ones from an early age can be beneficial in stopping these crimes. Parents should also monitor the websites that are being used by their children and should implement certain firewalls to prevent their exposure to certain sensitive websites. To sum up, the internet has made our lives easier by providing us various options to share our data. However it puts us at the risk of certain issues such as frauds, or scams. It also puts our privacy at risk. Even so, in my opinion, the impact of the internet on our lives is largely positive. As for the risks, there are several ways to mitigate them.

"Sample essay In a free society everyone should be able to express their thoughts and opinions freely. Unfortunately, if everyone freely expresses their thoughts, there will be more conflicts than consensuses because my words can offend or hurt another person. Because of this reason I believe that freedom of speech is essential for the functioning of a free society, but there should be some restrictions on it.  In this age of blogging and social media when anyone can become a writer and a publisher, freedom of speech is one of the most abused fundamental rights. Just because we are living in a free society, it does not mean that we should be allowed to say whatever we want. A lot of people have too much confidence in their constitutional right to freedom of speech. They freely post all kinds of stuff on social media and online forums. This leads to a lot of problems, even lawsuits. Posting derogatory stuff about another person just because you have the right to express your thoughts is not only mean but also illegal. In my opinion, there should be strict laws to deal with this menace. No one should be allowed to hurt another person in the name of freedom of speech or expression. Not only the citizens, the media also sometimes abuse their freedom of speech. They often publish private or sensational information about public personalities. Recently when the Indian Army was carrying out a military action against terrorists, a news channel broadcast up-to-the-minute details of the operation from the scene. They thought they were exercising their freedom of expression. Unfortunately, such thoughtless actions even put the safety of soldiers and civilians at risk. Also they reveal vital clues about the place using which terrorists can refine their attacks in the future. To conclude, freedom of speech should be entertained as long as it does not hurt the interests of others or the nation. When people express their thoughts, they have a duty to think about the consequences. What’s more, there should be stringent laws to deal with those who abuse their right to express themselves.",9,False,95.04824398880106,353
"Band 7 essay sample Most individuals are of the view that a good amount of wealth results into happiness, while some believe that being very rich has its own curse. In my opinion, I completely agree that a lot of money always brings with itself many unforeseen problems as well. Money and it’s vicious power to attract humans to fulfill their various wishes, at any cost, has always been debated. Earning sufficient money for one’s basic needs and amenities, as well as to fulfill their family obligations and provide them with suitable comforts of a modern life are very much justifiable. However, the issue arises when more wealth leads to a feeling of greed and a sense of invincibility amongst family and peers. As a result, a sense of suspicion, envy and jealousy creeps in within social relationships and takes a heavy toll on family matters as well. For instance, the recent war of words in public between Ambani brothers due to differences of opinion, for sharing and taking control of the vast business empire left over by their father. Such instances, due to fear of personal financial loss lead to permanent damage of relationships and split between families. Secondly, gaining more and more financial clout and enjoying the material luxuries the world has to offer, comes with its own set of sacrificies. Many high-earning corporate CEO’s and senior level management at most of these companies struggle with their daily hectic work schedules and get overburdened by the responsibilities, with the only aim of maximising the bottom line at all cost. This results in a serious issue of not being able to devote enough time to their family and friends, as well as a deterioration in their physical and mental well-being, and later at times leading to life-threatening diseases. A recent survey by Times showed that more than 40 percent of top executives in India are suffering from high-blood pressure and stress related issues. In conclusion, I believe that having too much money not only leads to issues in personal and family relationships, but also deprives one of a healthy and peaceful way of life that can be enjoyed with sufficient money.",7,False,87.20843672456576,360
"Although there are public schools which are completely funded by the government, private schools are not supported by the government and have hefty fee structure. In my opinion, private schools ought to be funded by the government too. This will be highly beneficial for those children who are not able to afford to study in the private schools. Firstly, by providing financial aid to the private schools, the government can make sure that there are some seats available for those students who have weak financial background. This will bring equality within the society and poor families who are not able to afford will not be left behind. This will be a positive step for a developing society and nation. Secondly, it is seen that in many countries such as India public schools have poor infrastructure, while private schools have far better facilities. Hence, if the government provides financial support to such privately owned schools, poor families too will be able to send their offspring to private schools and they will also be able to use the same infrastructure. A better infrastructure is indispensable for a better future and growth. Moreover, it can be seen that children from privileged backgrounds know better about the technologies and study options, and hence through regular interaction with such students, poor students can also learn a lot more. To conclude, if the government funds private schools poor students will be able to enrol in them and that will be hugely beneficial for the society. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The number of people eating fast food has been increasing since the last decade. The health problems associated with its consumption and increased financial spending outweigh the nominal benefits provided by it.  The only benefit of ready to eat food is that it is convenient. These days in many families both the husband and the wife work and they do not have time to cook proper meals. Consequently, they opt for fast food which they can buy from a store and eat without having to spend hours for cooking. Also, fast food may taste better because of artificial flavours and additives added to them. This is what attracts children to packaged foods. On the flip side, in spite of the minor advantages mentioned above, there are potentially dangerous drawbacks associated with fast food. One of the major issues is obesity. This is because sandwiches, burgers or pizzas contain very high amount of calories. This exceeds the daily dietary requirement of most people, and as a result they suffer from obesity and related diseases. In addition, convenience foods rarely provide adequate nutrition. Consequently, children who consume them regularly fail to develop normally. Another issue associated with the consumption of fast food is that they are expensive. They can hurt the budget of middle and low income families. In conclusion, the trend of people eating ready to eat food is associated with more drawbacks than benefits. It is hoped that people will realise the goodness of home-made meals and go back to them.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Some people tend to purchase expensive products even though they do not need them and land themselves in the debt trap. Commercial advertising, consumerism, and an increase in the usage of credit card are some of the reasons of this trend. However, there are several measures that can be taken to discourage people from over spending. These include encouraging saving habits and discouraging the use of credit cards. To commence with, it is a globally accepted fact that TV-advertisements have a significant impact on an individual’s life. These commercials presented and pretended to be used by famous celebrities easily grab people’s attention and drive them to buy it even though they do not need it. Moreover, consumerism is deleterious to the society. Some people cannot resist the urge to splurge after seeing attractive sales offers. Besides, increasing usage of plastic money mainly, credit cards, provides consumers the opportunity to spend more than they can afford. Many people intentionally use their credit cards to pay for an overpriced item, as they can pay off the money in installments. All these factors jointly persuade an individual to expend more than they can afford on needless things. However, discouraging the use of credit cards can prevent people to some extent from spending a greater amount of money on unwanted things. In addition, the government should encourage saving habits among people by introducing attractive deposit schemes.  In conclusion, though commercials, the consumptive lifestyle, and plastic money encourage people to spend more on unnecessary or useless things, encouraging saving habits and making credit cards inaccessible will coerce an individual to spend less and save more for future.

"In the contemporary era, culture is pretty much similar around the globe in comparison to the earlier times. This has become possible due to the advancement in the technology sector as well as globalisation. Although, identical culture of the countries removed the communication barriers and made the world a global village for festivals/events celebrations, it has posed a major threat to the indigenous cultures of myriads of countries. Moreover, the loss of cultural-diversity can be perilous for global tourism industry. I will discuss these points in the subsequent paragraphs. First and foremost, common culture eliminated / removed the communication barriers among countries and thus increased trade and commerce. As a result, economic prosperity has been observed among developing and under-developed nations. Moreover, the world has become a global village where festivals of all religions are celebrated with great zeal and zest. For instance, Christmas day is celebrated all over the world with immense enthusiasm and this has broken all the walls and united the entire world. Conversely, identical culture is posing a humongous threat to the indigenous cultures as people prefer to follow the trending cultures and traditions. Consequently, moral values which we learn through/from our culture and traditions are dying. Another negative aspect is the risk to global tourism industry. As most of the holidaymakers tend to visit places to explore different food and cultures, having a same culture globally could diminish the number of visitors exponentially. This can result in huge loss to global tourism companies and they might not be able to bear the losses. Hence, they will be forced to close down their businesses.  To conclude, admittedly, a common culture eradicates the communication barriers and promotes unity through global festivals and events. Nevertheless, it is dangerous for indigenous traditions and moral values as well as poses a threat to tourism industry at large. Globalization has a huge impact on cultures worldwide. It has been observed that now there are identical cultures across the globe in contrast to earlier times. In my opinion, this is a positive development as it helps people to get connected and build their understanding about other customs.  Admittedly, nowadays cultures and customs are similar internationally in comparison to previous times when these things were completely opposite and less known. In older days people did not use to travel much and had limited knowledge about other culture) especially about foreign cultures. Owing to globalization, indigenous values and customs started spreading globally and it / this helped people to understand and appreciate other cultures. For instance, owing to the establishment of a plethora of foreign companies in India, most of the companies have also started celebration of festivals such as Diwali and Holi along with festivals such as Thanks Giving Day and New Year. This teaches people to appreciate other cultures. Moreover, the merging of cultures of the nations worldwide gives people an opportunity to perform their rituals and still find acceptance among natives and non-natives. For instance, when I was in Dubai, I witnessed many Indians there celebrating Holi and the state government encouraged this. I also noticed that many natives also participate in such festivities.  In conclusion, because of the growing trade and commerce between countries, we see the merging of cultures everywhere today. In my opinion, this is a positive development because it helps people feel at home everywhere.  Do you have a letter on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"There is a general belief that the advertising industry uses immoral and objectionable methods to promote their products. I fully agree with this view. In my opinion, most ads either make false claims or are highly misleading. Advertisers try every trick in the book to sell their products. With the objective of grabbing more eyeballs, marketers often hire popular celebrities to endorse their products. When a popular actor or a successful sportsperson endorses a product people will assume that it is of a higher quality. For example, actors often promote beauty soaps, shampoos and creams. Gullible people buy those products hoping that if they use them, they will look like their idol. Such ads make false claims with the sole objective of increasing the sale of the product. Some companies market their products as something that only the rich can afford. The iPhone, for example, is ridiculously pricey and some cheaper phones have the same features and specifications. Yet, Apple’s marketing campaigns have made the iPhone a status symbol. Consequently, many lower and middle class people borrow money to buy it. Such campaigns are harmful and must be controlled.  Advertisements and promotions targeting children are even more dangerous. For example, the fast food chains MacDonald’s and Burger King give away free toys or drinks to attract children. Surveys have proved that their products are unhealthy and their regular consumption leads to health problems including obesity among children. Yet, these foods are marketed as healthy and nutritious. Creating awareness against the consumption of such foods alone will not help because children are too young to differentiate healthy and unhealthy food. Therefore, the government should either control the advertisements or ban them entirely. To conclude, I would like to say that although advertising plays a key part in marketing products, false and misleading advertisements should be regulated or even banned.

"A number of languages have gone extinct over the last few decades. Although many individuals are of the opinion that it is critical to preserve each and every language, I believe that having only a few common languages will make our lives easier. Each language is unique to a culture and learning it is a great way to understand that culture. Also, languages create a sense of unity and belongingness among people. For instance, whenever two individuals from the same country meet in a foreign place, they are excited to communicate in their native language. Obviously, language helps the bonding between people. On the other hand, in this age of globalization it is highly beneficial to speak a common language in order to avoid confusion and facilitate effective communication. Using a link language like English has helped nations to come closer and increased trade and commerce among them. If we had not chosen a single language to communicate globally, even the advent of technology could not have helped us to achieve the kind of progress we have achieved now. Much like work experience, knowing a widely used language helps the career prospects of individuals. For example, nowadays, English is the medium of instruction in a number of schools all over the world. Even in countries where English is not the first or second language, there are English medium schools because people have realized that this language is the key to professional success. In conclusion, although it is important to save the languages from dying, it is not hard to see that a common language is in everyone’s interest. It boosts trade and commerce between countries and enhances the career prospects of individual. Hence, in my opinion, the extinction of not so popular local languages is not a major cause for concern.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Language extinction is becoming increasingly prevalent in this day and age. Some people believe that this should not be a cause of concern as life will be simpler with fewer languages. I completely disagree with this opinion and I believe that life will still remain as complicated as it is even with fewer languages. Firstly, the number of languages that an average person is able to be comfortably fluent in will be two or three at the most. If people are of the opinion that the demise of certain languages would make it easier for them to use their native language for fluently communicating overseas for work or travel, they would be completely mistaken. This is because the countries have deep rooted traditions and cultures that cannot fade away so quickly. For instance, one would still have to learn Chinese or Japanese if they would like to work in either of these places.  Furthermore, countries with one language are not free from a complicated life. This is because the root of the complexities of lives does not reside in the number of languages that exists in the world, but in the way mankind treats one another. We could have two people in a room who speak the same language but have multiple disagreements and have another two who might get along very well despite the language gap.  In conclusion, I believe that life will not be much easier just because there are fewer languages. In fact, the world will be a much more interesting place if different cultures and languages co-exist. Also, ultimately life will become simplified only when the mankind shows the resolve to bridge the gap in their everyday communication. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is an irrefutable fact that chemicals such as flavour enhancers, preservatives, artificial colours and various stabilizers are added to convenient meals. Although there are certain advantages to this practice such as increase in the life of a product and enhancement of taste, the main drawbacks are that it has harmful effects in the long run and these chemicals make a person addicted to these foods. In my opinion, the disadvantages of these chemicals outweigh the advantages they offer.  Admittedly, there are some basic benefits to using these chemicals in the food. The first one is that it helps to increase the shelf-life of a product. This is because generally the life of the food is short and this makes them easily perishable. In order to tackle this issue, the manufacturers add these chemicals. For example, at least 98% of the processed food contains preservatives to add life and freshness to the product. Another advantage is that it enhances the taste and flavour of the food. In other words, these chemicals make the food more delicious regardless of their impact on one’s health and as a result, companies make a lot of profit. Despite the advantages above, I believe that there are some serious drawbacks to this trend. One potential issue is that these chemicals have a long lasting impact on one’s health. This is because they can cause serious health ailments such as cardiac issues, cancer and may also damage the central nervous system. Another disadvantage is that these chemicals are addictive in nature. This encourages a person to eat these foods very often and thereby increases the chances of these health ailments.  In conclusion, the serious health consequences of preservatives far outweigh the mere benefits of longer shelf-life and taste enhancement.

"Of late, more and more customers are moving to large shopping centers and malls rather than the small local shops, and this has forced these shops to close. In my opinion this is a negative development which can make people lose their jobs and also it may affect the tourism. One serious problem that can arise from the closure of the small shops is that the competition between the small shops and the large shopping centers will disappear. As a result the large malls will stop providing discounts on the goods as they do not face competition; therefore, they will not reduce the prices. For example, malls offer discounts throughout the year to keep their customers away from the small shops. Thus, the closure of small shops will affect the customers.  Another issue is that many people will lose their jobs and become unemployed. In other words, when the small shops close, people employed by them will lose their source of income, and that will put them in a difficult situation. For example, many families run small shops to earn their living. When they go out of business, their families will struggle to survive.  Finally, the closure of small shops in some places will affect the tourism industry. Many tourists prefer the small shops in the streets instead of the big malls, and the reason behind this is that walking in an old beautiful street watching people doing performances and other people shopping is more joyous than being inside a large building of concrete. In conclusion, although it has become easier for people to do shopping in one large center, the closure of small malls has brought too many problems for this to be considered a positive development.

"Man is a social being and no one can exist as an island. While some people hold the view that parents have the responsibility to teach their children to become a good member of the society, others feel that the school is the best place to learn social values. In my opinion, both the parents and the teachers have an indispensable role in shaping the character of their children. Firstly, parents are the primary teachers and home is the first school where the personality development of children is initiated. From birth to preschool children are under the sole custody of their parents. They imitate the actions of their parents and for this reason it is important for parents to become a good role model for their children. Parents are the best people to teach them the concept of good and bad. When they are taught to make this distinction from a young age, they are unlikely to go astray when they grow up. However, parents are not the only influence on children. Teachers at school have an equally important role to play in the formation of their character. The school is essentially a microcosm of the universe. Here the children get to interact with other children of different character, personality and family backgrounds. This exposure that they get at school plays a crucial role in the formation of their parents. It is the duty of parents to instil in them the values of discipline and social commitment. To conclude, parents and teachers both have an equally important role in moulding the character of children. In my opinion, their roles are complementary. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is certainly true that children are behaving more inappropriate these days; consequently, most people believe that the best way to discipline them is to give them physical punishment. I don’t agree with this view. I personally think that even if they behave badly smacking children is completely unacceptable. There are a number of reasons why parents consider the physical punishment as the best form of discipline. Firstly, they usually think that when children are smacked for bad behaviour they will learn that every action has a reaction. Secondly, adults constantly want to have control over their children and let them know who is in charge by this obsolete method. Finally, parents often want to make sure that their children will not repeat the bad behavior again by being afraid of the consequences. On the other hand, there are some strong arguments against smacking children.To begin with, physical violence is the worst solution to any problem; instead, there are other forms of discipline that produce positive results. Children learn a lot by watching and imitating adults. Parents should strive to be role models for children by behaving appropriately at all times. What is more, physical punishment could leave a severe trauma on children and they may behave even more inappropriately in the future. To summarise, children are the future of our society and adults should raise them with tolerance, patience and love. Being strict does not necessarily involve physical violence. Therefore smacking children to discipline them should be completely forbidden and parents who still do it, must be severely penalised by the law.",7,False,84.63111726685133,263
"It is a contentious issue whether surveillance cameras for security should be used or not. Some people argue that surveillance cameras help to reduce crime. However, others insist that the presence of cameras violate the privacy of people. In my opinion, the benefits offered by video cameras outweigh the disadvantages.  On the positive side, proponents of CCTVs put forth this argument that this initiative aids in reducing the crime rate. To elaborate, criminal activities often take place in the public places and installation of these electronic equipments in these places enables the police force to monitor the happenings.  In addition to that, recorded footage can be used in court as strong evidence. Therefore, culprits will think twice prior to committing a crime. In other words, this way of rendering protection will disseminate word to potential offenders; consequently, they will abstain from perpetrating the criminal act.  On the negative side, opponents argue that cameras violate the privacy of citizens, because, they invade personal space of people by recording their actions continuously. Furthermore, these gadgets are part of technology, which can be hacked and stolen information could be put into use for malicious purposes. Another reason is that perpetrators can hide their identity by covering face.  In this case, these security cameras are useless. To conclude, having analyzed both the merits and demerits, it is evident that video cameras are immensely beneficial for keeping a check on criminals and criminal activity. Thus, the advantages of installing CCTVs definitely outweigh the disadvantages which are rather insignificant.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is true that children are currently pressurised in every possible spectrum of their lives such as academic, social and commercial. The main cause of this is a lack of understanding among parents and schools. To help children overcome such pressures, parents should spend adequate time with their children and schools should make learning less stressful.  There are many reasons for the various pressures faced by children. Firstly, schools are overloading children with enormous amount of syllabus and frequent examinations. Due to this students tend to feel stressed about their academics and develop anxiety. Moreover, parents compare their children with others and their behaviour drastically affects children. Secondly, children also have to cope with peer pressure. This is because some students who indulge in wrongdoings such as smoking or consuming alcohol, often influence other children and this peer pressure eventually make them acquire bad habits. Finally, many children also face a lot of commercial pressures amongst their peers. The reason for this is that many schools do not have a protocol of following a standard uniform and this makes students compare their clothing with those of others and they tend to feel inferior about their dressing.  The possible solutions to solve the above mentioned issues are that the government should set a policy for schools to reduce the syllabus and minimise the number of examinations. This will enable students to be creative and become confident. Furthermore, parents should not compare their children with others as this behaviour demoralises them.  Parents should spend time with them and give moral lessons and this will make them avoid indulgence in wrongdoings. To reduce the commercial pressures on children, schools should impose a dress code system. In other words, if there is a standard uniform students will not compare their clothing with that of others and feel inferior. Also, they can focus more efficiently on their studies rather than these pressures.  In conclusion, if the above solutions are implemented with the help of parents and schools, then most of the students will gradually be out of pressures and stress.

"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.",8,False,90.3960979687194,338
"On several occasions, when we enter a restaurant or receive a home delivery, a student wearing a work cloak is on the other end providing the service. There are several factors that encourage students to take up part time jobs and this trend has both positive and negative aspects.  To start with the benefits, the youth reap a lot of benefits by working part-time. The extra source of income aids them in supporting the family besides covering their own expenses. If a student is prudent enough to acquire a position in a field relevant to their study, then the work experience elevates the standard of their resume. Students also learn effective time management when they work part time. Furthermore, an organised lifestyle impedes the youth from indulging in undesirable activities. On the down side, working while studying leaves the students with less or no time to nurture their hobbies or talents. What’s more, students working part time have to handle a lot of pressure at such a tender age. It could even hurt their performance at school or university because they may not have enough time for their studies. Many studies have proved that the academic output of youngsters with part-time job is not on par with their counterparts who do not work part time.

" It is often argued that the talent of a player can justify his inappropriate behavior on the ground. This essay disagrees with this view. Firstly, it can create discord among team members. Secondly, it will send the wrong message to their audience, especially young audience. A match is not about an individual player. Though you may have a brilliant player in the team, he alone can’t win matches for you. A suitable coordination is the key to success for a team and hence team manager needs to show unbiased treatment to all players irrespective of any individual’s performance. The zero-tolerance policy will ensure that there is no space for a trouble creator in the team and will ensure that all players treat others with dignity. For example, recently the Australian Cricket team banned their top-performing captain on the account of ball tempering and sledging. Sportspersons have a huge fan-following and that includes youngsters.  Because these supporters blindly follow their role models, they also mimic their actions in personal life which can create serious consequences for them. For example, after a recent clash between two senior players during the world cup match, their supporters also emulated the same action outside the ground and vandalized public properties. Police arrested all the offenders and imposed a heavy fine on them. In conclusion, there may be some supremely talented players in sports but it is the team effort which makes history and we can’t defend the irresponsible actions of a star player. Also, players need to exhibit exemplary behavior along with their skills as there are millions of young eyes always watching / following them. Hence, in my opinion, trouble makers must be punished and their talent cannot be an excuse for condoning their bad behaviour.",8,False,104.0533464616729,291
"These days, an internship has become a compulsory part of the university curriculum in which a student has to do an unpaid job in their prospective organization for a short duration. This process has numerous merits and a few demerits and in this essay, I will substantiate that the drawbacks of serving for free in a company can be overlooked when we consider its long-term benefits.  Looking first at the positives, the most significant advantage of doing internship is that it gives first-hand experience of the actual work scenario, and based on that the students can decide whether they are suitable for that job. In other words, during the internship period, the students acquaint themselves with the work culture, its different domains, and their tasks. Then according to their experience, they figure out their field of interest in which they want to build their career. Therefore, this working experience helps students to pave their career path. Furthermore, the chances of getting a job increase after doing an internship. The reason is that companies are generally looking for the potential candidates and if an intern proves his or her competence during that short period, then the company hires them as a permanent employee. Thus, it becomes a golden opportunity for students to get their dream job.  However, this process has some disadvantages too, especially when a student is from a humble background. As a matter of fact, these jobs are unpaid; therefore, it is tough for certain students to manage their expenses such as accommodation, food, and travelling charges. As a result, students suffer from financial crises.  In conclusion, although some students may encounter financial issues during internship, in my opinion, these problems can be ignored if we see the advantages that can significantly shape the career path of students.

"Some individuals contend that spare time should be spent on some healthy indoor activities such as reading and doing scrabble whereas others are inclined to the view that it is essential to rest without intentionally having any thoughts to recharge the mind. This essay will discuss both sides of this contentious argument and then I will give my own perspectives.  To begin with, reading and playing word games are effective ways for stress reduction. No matter how much stress we face in daily life, the stress may just slip away when we lose ourselves in a great story of a book or concentrate on solving the word puzzles. Reading helps to distract us from the tension we face and keeps us in the present moment.  In addition, these activities foster cognitive stimulation. Studies have shown that staying mentally active through activities such as reading and doing word puzzles preclude us from losing brain power and reduce the progress of Dementia. Just like any other muscle in our body, brain muscle needs to be exercised to stay active.  On the flip side, it is essential to not think about anything and give our mind some rest whenever we can. When we keep ourselves away from discursive thinking, it enhances our awareness and senses to engage with the surroundings without the burden to analyse every situation we observe and encounter. For instance, we always feel recharged and enter a state of peace and tranquillity when we rest our mind doing nothing especially after a busy day at work.  In conclusion, reading, solving word puzzles and keeping our mind free during leisure period bring merits to enhance the mind. Engaging in such activities is good for enhancing our creativity and cognitive skills. By contrast, resting the mind by doing nothing is a better way to beat stress.

"According to some people / a few people, the external appearance and dressing style of a person can reflect their cultural values and personality traits. Personally, I disagree with the opinion that the choice of clothing should be used to deduce the character of a person. Some of the sentiments and traditions can be inferred from the dressing one chooses to wear, but it is only limited to the externalities. For example, consider the Sikhs who wear the turban. It definitely gives us an idea about the background of the person and perhaps also his nationality. Likewise, most Muslim women wear burkha to show respect for their religion. However, a burkha only reveals the religion of a woman. It does not state anything about her character or personality. A person’s lifestyle, preferences and habits, on the other hand, give more clues regarding their character and personality. For instance, I have personally met many people who dress modestly but live a life full of passion, ambition and adventure. Obviously, there is little we can deduce from their choice of clothes. Mahatma Gandhi, who earned India independence from the mighty British Empire, was greatly admired for his right conduct and honesty. He used to wear only a loin cloth to cover his body but he possessed great virtues unknown to many. At first, the British rulers chose to ignore him because they could never imagine that a half-naked fakir would one day shake the very foundations of their empire. In conclusion, the choice of clothing or external appearances are not a reflection of a person’s culture or character. They can at best show whether a person is modern or traditional. They don’t give any clues to their character or values.",8,False,87.89074826679416,287
"Write at least 250 wordsEducation plays an imperative role in the overall progression of a country. Many people may heavily rely on quality education as preparation for real life employment and experiences. However, there are other factors that are needed to propel a country towards success.We must acknowledge the way the education system of a country prepares most individuals by equipping them with various skills. Prior to gaining a qualification to practice certain professions such as teaching, nursing or accounting, it is necessary for the individuals to undergo rigorous training. Certificate and diploma programs as well as university degrees are good examples of that. Some graduates may even choose to pursue further studies to attain certain requirements to be able to practice their chosen profession.The education system is undoubtedly important in preparing individuals to take on roles leading to the development of a country. However, it seems that producing graduates alone isn’t a guarantee of the advancement of a country. There are other factors that should come into play, and motivation of individuals is one. Without motivation, people may lose track of what they intend to do to contribute to the improvement of a country.  drives people to achieve and maximize their potentials, because they are determined to get better at many aspects of their life, eventually yielding improvement for their entire country.Furthermore, the availability of natural resources and job opportunities may also affect the growth of a national economy.

"Recent studies have shown that the number of people travelling internationally has increased tremendously. Tourism offers many advantages to the tourists as well as to the tourist places. However, this continuous growth in overseas traveling certainly creates some problems. Even so, in my opinion, the advantages of international traveling outweigh the disadvantages. Nowadays, more people are travelling internationally than in the past. They make plans to visit a new country or place with their families and these trips give them a chance to spend some quality time together. In this era of competition, everyone is busy with their tough work commitments. Therefore, a holiday brings families together and allows them to forget their stresses and enjoy their lives. Moreover, international travel tickets are cheap, which encourage more people to explore the world and discover new customs and cultures. International traveling also benefits the countries that are visited. For many small countries in Asia, Africa and Europe tourism is the main source of revenue. Most of the people living in famous tourist places earn money by selling souvenir and other items which represent their countries and culture. Consequently, the higher the number of visitors, stronger the economy of the nation. Last but not least, International travelling boosts peace and understanding among countries. On the other hand, there are a few disadvantages to international travelling. The increasing air traffic causes a great deal of environmental pollution and leads to many health issues. Also when more people visit famous historical places, they may cause some damage to the monuments or artifacts. In conclusion, the disadvantages of international traveling certainly do not outweigh the advantages. Even so, the downsides cannot be overlooked. Countries should take adequate measures to ensure that they reap maximum benefits from travel and tourism. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to some academicians, it is better to introduce a foreign language in elementary school than in secondary school. I agree with this view. In my opinion, young children are better at acquiring a new language than older children. Also, learning an additional language at a young age enhances their IQ.  One of the major benefits of introducing a new language early on is that it helps the child gain higher levels of proficiency in it. As a matter of fact, I grew up speaking three different languages from the age of 3 and because of this I have utmost confidence in using all of them. If I didn’t learn these languages from such an early age, I doubt that I would be fluent in them. Another advantage of learning an additional language is that it enhances the child’s cognitive skills. Studies have shown that multilingual people are smarter than monolingual people. It is no surprise then that Albert Einstein spoke 5 different languages from a young age and he was undoubtedly one of the greatest minds on earth. A potential disadvantage of learning multiple languages in primary school is that the child may confuse the foreign dialect and their native tongue. As a result, they may take longer to achieve fluency in their mother tongue. For example, we sometimes see that children born and brought up outside India have difficulty in conversing with their family in their native language. However, in my opinion, if parents make it a point to speak to their children in their mother tongue, this problem can be resolved easily. Another disadvantage of adding a new language to the primary school curriculum is that it puts an extra burden on children. Children already have a lot of subjects to learn and a new language can make the syllabus even heavier.  In conclusion, educating children to be multilingual from an early age promotes better language skills and a higher IQ in them. Parents and teachers just need to ensure that the new language does not become a burden for the kids. ",9,False,69.69100077579519,343
"There are still many places in the world where science courses in schools are dominated by male students. There are many factors contributing to this phenomenon and it needs to be changed so that the choice of study is made entirely by the student’s genuine interest.  One of the reasons for this trend is that boys are generally more competitive and they choose more challenging and physically demanding courses like science and engineering while girls opt to study less competitive subjects like literature and history. Furthermore obtaining science degrees guarantee better job opportunities and hence boys who are considered as future breadwinners opt to study these courses. In developing countries, the majority of girls are still expected to become housewives to take care of the family and the idea of them pursuing a career as a medical doctor or a scientist is not much appreciated. Therefore because of the peer pressure and social influences, many female students end up taking less demanding arts courses just to receive a degree although they might have passion for studying science.  My view is that the decision to pursue art or science should be made according to their interest and preferences and not be influenced by social pressure. I have seen a medical student who wanted to study Philosophy but his parents forced him to join medical school and he ended up dropping out from the course because of his poor performance in studies. Students will excel in their chosen fields only if the choice was made willingly. Women should also be empowered to gain more confidence to enter male dominated environments like engineering or IT. History has proven that women are as good as men in science as we have witnessed a lot of female Nobel Prize winners in science. In conclusion, gender stereotypes are still influencing the choice of study and career and I believe this trend should be changed. Every student should choose the subject they love regardless of their gender so that there will be more enthusiastic professionals in both art and science.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Band 9 essay sample It is a common practice all over the world for employers to interview potential candidates. While I don’t think that this is the best way to assess the job worthiness of a particular candidate, I cannot suggest any better alternatives. In my opinion, combining the interview with mock practical tests and written examinations is the best way of finding suitable candidates. Interviews certainly are useful in many ways. The fact that they are used all over the world is a clear sign that a lot of employers find them useful. During an interview, the employer can assess the personality of a candidate to a great extent. Also there are various techniques that the interviewers can use to find out how a particular person will behave in various situations. Interviews are particularly helpful for selecting employees whose jobs require them to interact a lot with potential clients and customers. For example, people working in sales, marketing, PR or HR need good people skills that can be measured during an interview. Perhaps the biggest downside of interviews is that the candidates can come prepared and turn the interview to their advantage. It is possible to give learned answers to questions asked during an interview. In addition, it is foolish to believe that all candidates will demonstrate their true nature or work ethics during an interview. Another disadvantage of interviews is that by interviewing someone, an employer can only assess their personality and general knowledge. An interview, for example, is not a good way of measuring a person’s technical skills. By simply interviewing someone who has a degree in engineering, an employer cannot find out whether they have the skills required to deliver a good performance at the workplace. In such situations putting the candidate through tasks they would have to typically do before offering them a job is a better solution. To conclude, while it is true that an interview is not the best method of choosing a candidate, there aren’t many better alternatives. In my opinion, employers should combine the interview with written tests and mock practical tests to find the most suitable employees.  ",9,False,75.5053153266995,356
"The soaring unemployment rate has been a huge problem for many governments nowadays. Some people suggest that senior employees over 55 should be encouraged to retire so that they can make room for young people. Personally, I disagree with this idea. It is true that if many elder people leave their jobs when reaching a certain age, more vacancies will be available, and then young people are able to secure a job easily. This will greatly reduce the unemployment rate in the society. Furthermore, with more young employees, enterprises can be more dynamic because young people tend to be more creative and innovative. However, I believe setting 55 as the retirement age is inappropriate.  Firstly, 55 is too young for most healthy adults to retire today. Modern people’s life expectancy has significantly improved as a result of the advances in science and medicine. It is not reasonable to ask healthy senior citizens, especially those who have great expertise, to stop working at such a young age. On top of that, their leaving could give rise to the shortage of skilled labour force, which subsequently would have an adverse impact on the efficiency and productivity of a company. Furthermore, if those who are still competent for their job were required to go home just because they are 55, they would perhaps feel unvalued and discriminated against. This might push them into depression and affect their mental wellbeing eventually. In conclusion, encouraging old staff to retire at the age of 55 can help boost employment among young people and invigorate the company, but in my opinion, it is neither fair nor reasonable for many specialized senior employees and their companies.

"What sort of punishment should parents and teachers be allowed to use to teach good behaviour to children? Band 7 IELTS essay sample Punishment is nowadays a controversial topic. Although sometimes it is thought that punishment is not necessary to teach children about what is right and wrong, I believe that kids ought to learn that every cause could have a positive or negative consequence. In the olden times harsh punishments were used as method to teach people the distinction between right and wrong. For example, in the past, both teachers and parents used physical punishment as an option to discipline children when they did something wrong. However, over time, punishment became very controversial to the point that psychologists and educators started rejecting its use. In spite of this, I strongly believe that some sorts of punishment are necessary to teach kids the difference between right and wrong. Firstly, it is important to clarify that physical punishment must not be given at any moment. In other words, irrespective of children´s bad behaviour violence is not accepted under any circumstance. Nevertheless, some punishments such as refusing to give presents to children and restricting some benefits like play dates, the use of the TV, the Internet and any electronic device at home, as well as giving extra homework and social jobs such as helping other classmates and teachers and cleaning jobs during recess could be used by parents and teachers as lessons to show children that negative behaviour will always have a negative consequences. In conclusion, despite opinions to the contrary, I think that some sorts of punishment will allow children to understand and learn what is right and what is wrong.

"According to some people, when we visit a foreign country we should accept /embrace its customs and practices. In my opinion, it is all right to adapt to another culture; however, it should not be at the expense of our own culture. / In my opinion, one should only accept those elements of the foreign culture which one finds acceptable /comfortable with. While visiting foreign countries or living abroad, one should try to embrace the foreign style of dressing, food habits and other practices only if one finds them pleasant to follow. There is no point in doing something just to fit in. However, before visiting a foreign country it is important to acquire a thorough understanding of their symbols, gestures and heritage to avoid causing offence.  The acceptance of another culture and lifestyle symbolizes respect for the new community and promotes healthy human relations. For instance, candidates running for American President often talk about their admiration for Indian culture to win the vote of Indian Diaspora living in America. That is because as human beings we automatically develop a liking for those who respect our culture and values. Hence, regard for another culture goes a long way in forming long-lasting connections between people of different race and ethnicity. Although an individual should be appreciative of the practice of the country he visits, they should not be compelled to give up their own customs. Every region has their own religious beliefs and way of living and people should have the freedom to choose the best lifestyle for themselves. This also ensures harmony among the various ethnicities living together. For instance, India is a country of many religious groups preaching their own teachings and language. In such a country, the peaceful environment is maintained by giving everyone the right to select their way of life. In conclusion, it is a good way of showing acceptance and affection towards others by following their rituals and ideology but it needs to be an option, not an obligation for visitors to comply with. Affection and harmony can only prosper when everyone shows respect for each other’s traditions voluntarily by choice. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In most regions of the world, the ritual of having meals with family is fading away. This situation is a consequence of the busy schedule and globalization. I believe that this situation is not good for people and leads to disintegrated and unhealthy families. To start with, the major reason why families are unable to have meals together is the busy schedule and aspirations of the current generation. People in current times are very competitive and aspire to have high profile lives. Consequently, they take up highly paid jobs and end up having a busy lifestyle / schedule. Secondly, addiction to social media has led to a situation where people are only interested in their virtual friends. This also leaves them with no time for their family. Finally, people in this global world coordinate and work with teams located in different time zones leading to changes in lifestyle and mealtimes. The above situation has led to detrimental effects on the family life. The most vulnerable members of the family are children and they start to disassociate themselves with the family and lose their appetite as a result. Children in current times have their meals in school with no family members, which have a lot of psychological impact on their mental health. Secondly, it leads to people having quick breaks with no proper meals with the family. Furthermore, it results in a situation where people get affected with diseases   like diabetes, acidity and other digestive imbalances.

"Band 9 essay sample There are arguments both in favour of and against giving homework to students. While some people believe that homework is beneficial to children, others argue that it is an unwanted burden on them. In my opinion, a small amount of homework will help students to improve their grades; however, I am against giving too much homework. The biggest advantage of homework is that it encourages students to open their books and revise their lessons after reaching home. And if they do their homework with concentration, they will also learn the lessons. This will definitely improve their grades. If teachers do not give homework, most students will simply waste their time after reaching home playing video games or chatting with their friends. They will have to work doubly hard when exams draw closer. By encouraging students to learn the lessons the day they are taught, homework helps them improve their grades. On the other hand, homework can also be an unwanted burden. Most students spend a lot of time in the classroom. They are already tired by the time they reach home and lack the motivation to complete their homework. If they do homework it is for fear of punishment. When children are forced to do homework, they are less likely to focus on what they are doing. They may just copy answers from their notebook. This practice will not benefit them in any way. This, however, does not mean that teachers should stop giving homework. They can make homework less of a burden by giving only a small amount of it. This way they can ensure that students have time for play as well. Studies have shown that physical activity also helps brain development and boosts grades indirectly. To conclude, the practice of giving too much homework should definitely be discouraged as it is unhealthy and useless. However, abolishing homework is not the solution. Instead of taking such drastic measures, in my opinion, teachers should just reduce the amount of homework they give.",9,False,73.55121951219512,336
"The urban population around the world is increasing at an astonishing rate and this trend has put a strain on social resources. Some people suggest that public parks in cities should be converted to business or residential areas to meet the growing need for land. I completely disagree with this point of view. Green areas in cities play an important role in maintaining people’s health. To begin with, trees and other plants in public parks can absorb carbon dioxide and other chemicals in the air and this helps to provide better air quality for everyone living / everyone who lives in the city. This improvement can be crucial for those people who are suffering from breathing disorders because of the deteriorating air pollution. Another reason to maintain public parks is that they make a good place for people to exercise and stay fit. Regular exercise helps people build a stronger body, boost their immune system and thus protect them from catching illness. Moreover, gardens and parks can make cities more visually appealing. If our cities were only filled with skyscrapers, residential areas and business districts, our lives would be dull and bored; whereas the trees and flowers can make our lives more colorful and bring people closer to the nature. Finally, I would argue that building residential apartments and business centers is not a real option to address the issues brought by urban expansion. In my opinion, a better solution is that the governments should start to build more satellite centers outside already crowded downtown areas. This would not only provide more employment opportunities in suburban areas and boost economic growth but also relieve the air pollution and traffic problems in cities.  To conclude, I strongly believe that public parks in the cities should be reserved as it is beneficial to both citizens and civic landscape. To deal with the growing needs for land use, governments should take other measures such building more suburb centers.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to a large number of people, exercise is good for young children and teenagers. Hence, schools should make physical education and sports mandatory for all students. In my opinion, I completely agree with this idea of giving importance to physical education and sport in the school curriculum. To start with, exercise is the key to physical and mental health. It keeps the body of a child active and brings enthusiasm in him to complete other activities during the day. As most of the physical exercises are done in open grounds, they give young people a chance to connect with the nature. In addition, youngsters who play sports on a regular basis learn to accept success and defeat gracefully. These players get to compare their performance with each other and get encouraged to perform better. Team spirit is also one of the major benefits of playing sports which includes team participation. Moreover, these exercises and sports help children to fight their sedentary lifestyle. For example, a child who has a sports competition next week will practice his skills at home as well. It also encourages the parents to spend their time with their children to train them for the league. This makes the entire family shift towards a healthy lifestyle that consists of regular physical exercise. Introducing exercise in the school timetable helps students to get a break from the exhaustive academic subjects and return to it with renewed interest. A student who is not very strong at academics gets a wonderful opportunity to build her career in sports if these sports are taught at school. In conclusion, I strongly support the idea of making physical exercise and sports compulsory in primary and secondary learning institutions because sports benefit the overall growth and development of children.

"Language is crucial for expressing ideas and emotions. Although there are numerous languages in the world in my opinion it is important for everyone to learn English because of its reach; however, I also believe that it is equally important to ensure the survival of local languages. One’s native language represents one’s culture. It is a cultural heirloom that belongs to the entire community. I am of the opinion that literature in our local language teaches us a lot of values which are required for protecting our identity in this world of commercialization and globalization. By contrast, English is a language widely used all over the world. It is usually taught in school along with other local languages. It serves as a bridge between people whose first language is different. Moreover English literature is rich in history, values and ethics. Being able to read and write English is no doubt an achievement in this age of globalization. Hence I reemphasize the importance of learning English. However, preserving local languages is as important as learning English. If local languages are not taught, they will soon become extinct. Therefore, efforts have to be made to ensure their survival. A good solution is to teach both the languages at school. Parents should make it a point to converse with their children in their mother tongue. Schools should also enact plays in local languages and organize reading sessions. For instance, we were taught English and Sanskrit) in school and every afternoon for about fifteen minutes, five students each had to read a few pages of the holy book Bhagavad-Gita which is written in Sanskrit . This made sure that all students learnt the language. To summarize, English ensures barrier free communication among people and local languages help us carry forward our culture to the future generations; therefore I cannot stop emphasizing the importance of learning and teaching both the languages.

"Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as  of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos  at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call  “social anxiety disorder”. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.",8,False,114.26020244977258,276
"Nowadays, international tourism is growing at an unprecedented rate. Most of the people opine that this is having a negative impact on their countries. In this essay, I shall discuss two main reasons why people think like this and also recommend some methods to change their attitude towards foreigners. There are many reasons why most people are against international tourism. Firstly, tourists often disrespect the local culture. As a result, clashes sometimes occur between locals and visitors. Tourists may also spoil heritage buildings by writing on the walls. To illustrate, many tourists visiting the old traditional buildings located at Delhi have been found guilty of writing love notes on their walls. This has adversely affected the original essence of monuments. The huge influx of tourists may also lead to environmental issues. Many times foreigners are least bothered about the environment of the host nations. As a result, they throw rubbish around. Thus, they leave a bad impact on the local people. However, the attitude of the people living in the host countries can be changed if tourists become conscious of their actions. The government should launch awareness campaigns among tourists to dress and behave appropriately when they visit. In addition, the government can launch various programmes to ensure that locals benefit from tourism. In conclusion, cultural difference between locals and tourists is the main reason that encourages people to think that international tourism is bad. However, by launching schemes that make local people a direct beneficiary of tourism, the government can change this mindset. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"There is no denying the fact that with the advent of technology, most of the work in the modern era is being done with the help of machines. This essay intends to analyze the advantages and disadvantages of this development. On the positive side, the use of machines has helped to reduce human effort and time being spent at workplaces. Machines have also helped enhance productivity. For instance, a packaging company which packs various products like cookies, peanuts, fruits or vegetables, are now able to package several hundred pieces at  the same time with the use of conveyer belts and sealing machines whereas in the earlier times, they needed lots of manual labour and several days to complete the same task. On the negative side, manual work being replaced by machines, poses a serious threat to the health of an individual. Thanks to the availability of home appliances like grinders and facilities like online shopping, people no longer have to flex their muscles to get the job done. This transition from an active lifestyle to a sedentary lifestyle hurts their fitness levels and leads to various diseases in the long term.  In addition to this, as most of the work is done by robots, the need for human labour is decreasing and this ultimately leads to unemployment. In conclusion, there is no doubt that machines are efficient tools for saving time, energy and man labour, but at the same time excessive use of machines in the workplace leads to unemployment. Over dependence on machines also causes health problems in humans. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Band 7.5 IELTS essay sample Parenting plays a crucial role in the development of a child. Some claim that children should do only what their parents have told them to do whereas, others think they should be their own decision maker. I personally believe that listening to their guardians is important, but being able to think and act independently is far more crucial. To begin with, the main reason to listen to parents is that the young mind is too immature. Children are not mature enough to decide what is right and what is wrong, and most of the time they end up choosing the negative side because at that age they are attracted to do such things and thus spoil their life. For example, a global research group conducted a few tests among 9 to 16 year olds by asking a few questions. It was shown that 85% of the kids were prone to making wrong choices. So, for this reason parental supervision of children is beneficial. However, too much of this is going to ruin the child’s ability to tackle situations on their own. On the flip side, following one’s own judgment builds individuality which is a much needed quality in life. The constant involvement of parents during the growing up years of a child may make them incapable of fixing their own issues when they grow up.  Furthermore, individuality builds confidence in children and makes them capable of standing up for their own and achieve greater heights in life. It is a proven fact that children who stood for themselves are more successful in future than, who did not. This proves why it is important for children to listen to themselves. To recapitulate, although obeying parental commands is going to help you in making right choices, it will ruin your goals, if you do that for too long. Hence, every younger person should follow their own judgment for their better future.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"It is true that a large number of criminals do not change and keep on committing crimes even after punishment. There are several reasons for repeating crimes after serving a term and various steps can be taken to prevent such behaviour at societal as well as government level. There are a few reasons to explain the behaviour of criminals after they come out serving time in prison. Firstly, although they might be reformed individuals, some societies still see them as guilty and do not accept them as members of their community. The rejection and social alienation tempt ex-prisoners to take revenge and commit crimes again. Secondly, their past criminal records make it difficult for ex-prisoners to find employment. Consequently, they get into crime to get over their poverty. Finally, some are professional criminals. They want to earn money quickly so they commit crimes like burglary, extortion, robbery and blackmailing. They are so used to making money easily that they cannot stop it even after getting punished. There are several actions that can be taken to curb the problems. The government should enforce strong vocational training so that they do have options available when they are released. Apart from that, all prisoners should be counselled by psychologists who can evaluate their behaviour and mental status. This way, potential re-offenders can be identified easily and special attention be given to them. In addition to that, it is the responsibility of the police department to train and educate the public about the behavioural and circumstantial aspects of any crime. By doing so, they can create acceptance for reformed criminals and give them an opportunity to lead a normal life after serving punishment.

"People have various opinions about exceptionally high income only available to a few people. While some insist that the government should intervene to distribute income more evenly, others believe that this phenomenon is beneficial to the development of a nation. I opine that the government should facilitate an environment where economic activities are freely conducted without any limitation, but, at the same time, they should aid people lacking basic needs with welfare schemes.  On the one hand, some claim that the government has to have the control over income levels. Capping the remuneration/salaries can alleviate the magnitude of economic inequality to a certain degree in the first place. However, when if it is implemented for a long-term period, it can discourage people’s morale to attain their goal and they end up working in a passive manner. As a result, the advancement of the society will be hindered and the economic status will stay in a plateau. On the other hand, others consider the high salaries of a few people as instrumental to the growth of a nation. The primary reason for this is that this can stimulate the rest of the people in a positive way. Normal people strive to work harder to reach their individual goal and in the pursuit of the goal, the nation will flourish economically. However, in an exceedingly polarized economy, people are more likely to give up pursuing their goal out of relative deprivation. Thus, the government should launch more welfare programs in that society to fulfill people’s needs and this measure is a lot more beneficial than imposing a limit on upper salaries. To conclude, capping the amount of income people can earn will certainly reduce economic inequality. However, it will also discourage people from working harder and ultimately prove detrimental to the economy. Hence, in my opinion, rather than limiting the salaries of high net worth individuals, the government should launch welfare schemes for the poor. Overall, this is a good essay. You have addressed the task well. This seems to be in the band 7 to 7.5 range to me. ",8,False,77.09058593407951,346
"Nowadays, in our competitive world, to succeed, knowledge from school and university is not enough. Therefore, students who study from the school to university get fewer benefits and contribute less too, compared to those  who travel or work and get experience and skills . There are two following reasons to support for my opinion. I refer to the group of people who study from school to university as ‘group A’ and the other group – as ‘group B’.Firstly, at school and university, what group A gains is almost entirely theory, theory and theory. Of course, theory is very , however, you can’t do everything with just theory. You must have  experience. This is what group A . Although in the third or fourth year at university, group A can be apprentices in some companies, to help them approach their future jobs, they aren’t trained well because of the short time spent working. And the real job is still very strange to them. After graduating, without experience, group A students can’t accomplish their work perfectly. On the other hand, it takes them time and money to keep up with other experienced students and they may be scorned. Therefore, group A students can contribute less than group B who have the two most important things: skills and experience.Secondly, as group A students are contributing less, they surely get less benefit. Moreover, many companies which employ people in group A have to train them from ground-up. These companies take this cost from group A’s salary to reduce the risk of their employees leaving to other companies after being trained. So, less benefits are unavoidable and certain,  group B members are more loyal and effective workers. They also have useful experience and skills. Besides, their education is the same as or even higher than that of group A. As the result, group B gets more benefits absolutely.In conclusion, I think a student should travel or work before going to the university. That way, not only will they have basic knowledge but also skills and experience which are useful for them to get a good job and have a brilliant future.",7,False,56.490603363006926,352
"The advancement in the field of science and technology has enabled most employers to remain in touch with their employees beyond official working hours. While it may have a few advantages, I believe that the disadvantages of this extended contact after office hours and even on holidays outweigh any possible benefit. There are only a few positive aspects to being able to contact employees at at all times. It allows smooth flow of information between colleagues and enhances their coordination. It may be necessary in the case of people working in fields such as police department or emergency health care. In these occupations it may be pertinent to obtain certain pieces of information from employees immediately, and one cannot wait for their vacations to get over. However, only a handful of jobs would necessitate such a situation. Conversely, there are numerous drawbacks to being in constant touch with one’s official colleagues. Invariably, such flexibility results in employers repeatedly contacting their workers beyond their stipulated official hours for trivial things. The result in that some employees are never able to take work off their minds even during holidays. Their mind is constantly thinking of some official work or the other. This leads to unnecessary stress among employees. And their work efficiency reduces drastically. Furthermore, being in constant touch with colleagues through phone or emails hampers the family relationships and the social life of most people. This adds to their stress levels leading to further decline in their work output. Hence, such frequent contacts are not beneficial for either employees or employers. To conclude, in my perspective, barring a few professions, employers should not be encouraged to contact their workers after office hours. This is because the negative impacts of doing this are far greater than the positives.",8,False,92.03584229390681,296
"It is true that a large number of people throughout the world suffer from hunger even though the agricultural sector has seen many technological developments. There are several reasons for this and the lack of resources and adverse weather conditions are the most important among them. However, there are some measures that can be implemented to tackle this problem.  One of the significant reasons for why people do not have enough food supplies is unevenly distributed resources. In other words, it is known that most people who suffer from hunger are from underdeveloped countries where they have no financial support to conduct researches in farming. Moreover, climate change and geographical differences aggravate this problem. For instance, adequate rain, sunshine and nourished soil are the main requirements for growing crops but they barely exist in some countries in Africa. On the other hand, even though some country has a rich harvest of crops, it is likely to be destroyed by flooding or other natural disasters which might be caused by climate change. There are many solutions that can be implemented / taken to overcome this trend. Firstly, developed countries can aid poor countries by sharing their technology and financial resources so that those countries can conduct research to find solutions to tackle the famine. Consequently, super seeds and plants can be invented which could stand against undesirable natural conditions even if they are not blessed with best weather conditions. Finally, it is essential to tackle climate change with immediate effect. Otherwise, it will impact the whole world in a negative way.  In conclusion, it is true that a significant number of people in the world suffer from famine even though many farming advancements are currently in use. This can be overcome by providing the knowledge and financial aids for people who need it the most. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The World Cup football  and the Olympics are held worldwide with great national support and expectations. As a fan of those competitions, I agree with the idea that sporting events can be necessary for international relations and national unity. .First of all, the World Cup, Olympics and other international games work for easing tensions among different nations. For example, South and North Korea have football games regularly  two nations a chance to understand each other . In the mid  of North Korean supporters came to South Korea with the footballers and they were very excited during the sporting events. Even if it sounds ridiculous, many South Koreans were quite surprised at that moment when North Koreans shouted and cried during the match.

"During the last five years the world has observed a revolutionary trend in the way consumers buy products. Online shopping has caught the fancy of consumers. The trend shows that internet based online shopping is going to surpass traditional shopping by the end of this financial year. Though there are many advantages of online shopping, observers feel that traditional way of shopping also has its advantages and it cannot be replaced by online shopping. Online shopping started at the end of nineties. But the premature bubble of dotcom boom burst in 1999. Industry learned from its mistakes and the new generation was more equipped with new ideas which led to success. Flipkart and Snapdeal in India, Alibaba in China and Amzon in the USA have become biggest wealth creators in this space. Very easy to shop from even the confines of an office or a bedroom, no need to go to market and spend time and no need to bother about traffic or parking are some of the primary reasons for the consumers to go online for shopping. Many a time large discounts are also given on online portals. Mainly the lower overhead cost enables the online stores to sell products cheap. Online sites have become a boon during the inflationary era. All these lead to massive boom in the sector and it has attracted lots of investments resulting in greater opportunities of employment. Though online shopping seems to be the future, many people believe that it cannot be a replacement to in-store shopping. Though youngsters like to shop online, those who are still not comfortable to use internet, like to shop from shops. Apart from this, wearable products like cloths, sunglasses or shoes require to be checked for their look and feel before buying and the online store cannot provide them. Besides this, there is a large population that derives its living from these brick and mortar shops. So it is also required to support in-store shopping. It is clear that the world has decisively moved to online shopping, but it will not kill the traditional way of shopping. Both types of shopping have their advantages. However to be relevant in the market, the traditional retailers have to learn to do business online.",7,False,57.802422271832725,373
"These days, shopping has become increasing popular among people. Some people argue that shopping preferences of a person is determined by their age. I do not quite agree with this view. While I do admit that youngsters and teenagers tend to shop more than elderly people, a person’s ability to shop is ultimately determined by their financial status. Rich people tend to shop more than poor people. This is not necessarily because their needs are greater. They buy more because they can afford it. Conversely, poor people cannot afford shop frequently because their financial situation does not permit it. Of course, there are some people who borrow money to buy things, but they cannot carry on this habit for long because there is a limit to the amount of credit a person can get. Having said that, the age of a person may also influence their shopping habits. Impulsive buying, for example, is more common among adolescents and youngsters. They often follow fads and buy things that they may or may not need. They are also more likely to invest in clothing, gadgets and personal care products. Even so, not every youngster spends in the same way.  Young people coming from rich family backgrounds certainly spend more than their poor counterparts. Another factor that could influence the shopping habits of people is their values and beliefs. People who believe in simple living are unlikely to splurge even if they can afford it. In conclusion, the financial situation of a person is the first and foremost factor that determines their shopping habits. Age and value systems are also influential factors, but they are not more important than the purchasing power of a person.  ",9,False,65.94477672069169,282
"It is considered by some people that youngsters should allocate much of their leisure time to their families, while others contend that they should enjoy themselves outside. In my opinion, spending time with family is far more important than being outside. In this essay I will discuss both sides of the view and support it with valid arguments and examples. Those who believe that the time with the family at home is more significant have their justifications. The main reason for this argument is that young people can learn moral and ethical values in a safe way when they spend time with family because a family is the place where children imbibe these values in order to conduct themselves well in the world.  Moreover, this time can be used to strengthen the bond with their family. In contrast, if they do not spend quality time with their loved ones, the ties between the family will not be strong enough. Studies have shown that children who spend more time with their family have better manners and are more conscientious than their counterparts. Thus, family time is of utmost importance for young ones. On the other hand, some people opine that having an escape route to the outer world is significantly vital.  This is because it is a great opportunity to break the monotony of the daily life. This fills the millennials with new energy; therefore, they can be productive at school later. In addition, it is an excellent way to learn interpersonal skills in order to make new connections at work to be successful. In contrast, people who did not interact much outside of their family while growing up could turn out to be introvert and fail miserably in making real connection at their workplace.  In conclusion, although going out to enjoy themselves helps making new connections, the values that parents can teach in a family setting are invaluable. I believe that young people should not only devote their spare time to family, but also manage to take some time from their busy schedule for themselves.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is considered by some people that the future standard of health and well-being of the society will probably be low as compared to today’s state. I completely agree with this opinion as there are manifold reasons for this. To begin with, pollution is a prime contributing factor to the deterioration of people’s health. This is to say that due to modernization, people suffer from air, water and noise pollution. This will definitely continue in the future because the population will increase. This extremely affects our children when they commute to school or during their play outdoors and, in turn, negatively impacts the health level of the future generation. To illustrate this effect, a recent study by a well-known newspaper reveals that the majority of Asian children aged below 10 years suffer from respiratory diseases. This clearly shows that long-term diseases start from childhood. Another important factor that contributes to decreasing the health standard is the poor agricultural techniques that include more usage of harmful pesticides and fertilizers. As a result, the food items such as rice, vegetables, and fruits get contaminated with the residue of these chemicals. If this continues, the future generation will not be able to consume uncontaminated healthy food. This will certainly lead to some diseases and an overall decline in health. A recent survey states that 85% of diseases are caused by the poor quality food consumed by people.  To sum up, the level of health and well-being of people will probably decline in the future because of the growing levels of pollution and poor agriculture techniques. Got an essay on this topic?

"There is no doubt that many people are getting too fat these days, and it is the most serious health concern of the day. In order to address this problem, some opine that the prices of unhealthy foods should be increased. While I agree with this point to some extent as this can stop people from eating too much fast foods, I would also argue that other measures are necessary to uproot this mammoth problem.  To begin with, if the price of the junk foods which make people corpulent is increased, then they will seldom buy these types of items because of the high cost. A recent survey published in Hindustan Times, a well-known Indian newspaper, gives evidence that by imposing extra tax on the high-calorie foods, like burgers, cakes, and pastries, the Delhi government encouraged their residents to cut the consumption of these food items by a half. However, this cannot fully overcome the issue of overweight / obesity because it is nearly impossible to stop people from craving for fast foods even after increasing their prices. Nevertheless, the other method that can play a pivotal role in tackling this conundrum is to motivate people to do more physical activities. The reason for this is that most of the people, especially in the big cities, do the desk job where they have to sit on a chair for the whole day; that is why lack of physical movement of the body is making them obese. The best we can do in this scenario is to create awareness among people about the benefits of body exercise and encourage them to spare some time from the day for their physical well-being. Consequently, adopting these habits might succour people to overcome the issue of heavy body weight. To recapitulate, it is undeniable that myriads of people, nowadays, are gaining a lot more weight. Although making fattening food pricey for the general people can reduce this issue to some extent, to fully eradicate this issue people should get up from their couches and engage in physical activity.

"Nowadays, it is quite common for ordinary people to imitate the lifestyle of celebrities. The factors contributing to this phenomenon will be outlined in this essay along with the reasons why I think this is a curse rather than a blessing. Multiple contributors result in this trend. It is widely accepted that the majority of well-known persons are living under spotlights and acquire innumerable / numerous fans who choose to show their support to those celebrities by coping their idols’ deeds. In addition, in the modern society, most people care more about their physical appearance and opt for wearing fashionable clothing or using other fashionable products to keep their attractive image. Meanwhile, those famous people are often hired by fashion brands to endorse their products, and this makes ordinary people believe that wearing what celebrities wear is essential to look fashionable. Thus, it is not uncommon for a large proportion of them to imitate those famous people.  I believe this is a negative development. To begin with, the majority of celebrities can monetize their accounts and accumulate their wealth instantly, so they have strong financial capacity to afford those fashionable products whose costs are exorbitantly high. However, for average persons, it is a struggle to afford those pricy products, since their incomes are relatively low. Therefore, they have to reduce the money spent on other facets of their lives such as working out and further education, lowering their life standards. Besides, it is not uncommon for a large number of celebrities to be involved in various behaviors including drug abuse and tax evasion, to name a few. If those fans mimic their idol’s such deeds, they will embark on the wrong path.  In conclusion, average people are imitating celebrities because of their admiration for them and their aspiration to create a better image of themselves; however, in my opinion, this is a negative development because celebrities have flaws just like anybody else and imitating every action of theirs is never advisable.",8,False,104.47791164658635,330
"Nations around the globe launch different schemes and programmes for the upliftment of less privileged sections of the society. Many people insist that the government must ensure the well-being of people who don’t have a job or home. While it is true that by helping the poor and the destitute the government can reduce the crime rate, I disagree with this approach to a great extent. When the authorities take care of the basic needs of underprivileged people of a society, the number of crimes they commit plummets. Unemployment and homelessness frustrates individuals especially youngsters. As a consequence, they commit heinous criminal activities to give vent to their anger. However, if the authorities equip the unemployed with the skills which can easily earn them a job or provides homeless with a roof to stay, many of these issues can be easily tackled. For instance, in India various free training camps are regularly organised to teach vocational skills to the jobless young people. According to official data, this has dramatically reduced the number of crimes committed in different states. On the other hand, providing financial assistance to the less-advantaged will take a toll on the economy of the country. It is a known fact that economies around the world need to allocate a considerable proportion of their budget to more serious issues like health, education and national security. If the large portion of the country’s budget is used for the rehabilitation of jobless and homeless, other more urgent problems will be left out. As a result, the nation’s development will come to a halt and all the citizens will eventually suffer. For example, in Nigeria, the government implemented the scheme for the rehabilitation of homeless people, but the scheme failed badly. The failure has been attributed to the negative effect this scheme had on Nigerian economy. In conclusion, although governmental assistance for the welfare of the disadvantaged can certainly decrease the crime rate, I believe that any scheme or programme for their betterment will negatively impact the economic balance of the nation. A country should strike a balance between development and upliftment.",8,False,82.0667098445596,351
"It is argued that the internet has facilitated better connectivity and improved communication among users resulting in a more connected and accessible world. As far as I am concerned, this I true. In this essay I will support the above argument and mention the impact of the internet on communication and connectivity among people. The internet has made it easy to connect to a person in any part of the world anytime. Earlier it was a tedious and time consuming process. In the present era, there are a number of ways such as the email, web-chat and VOIP calls to stay in touch with our near and dear ones or colleagues. Modern internet based computer and mobile applications have made it easier to establish a connection or send a message at any time we want. Ease of accessing technology has also increased the number of internet users dramatically. For instance, earlier people used to make international calls by using traditional landlines but now recent surveys show that over 85% of cross-border calls are made using the internet. Another aspect behind the success of the internet is its exponentially falling service charges. Earlier the cost of Telegram or ISD calls was too high for ordinary people to afford. By contrast, advancement in telecommunication equipment and increased competition among internet service providers have pushed the internet service cost considerably down. This has been proven a boon for internet users. The internet is now almost free in comparison to its service charges used to be in early 20s. For example, in 1995 the connection charge for a one minute call between New Delhi and London was approximately 100 rupees while it has become free now through internet calling. To conclude, the internet is a huge success because of the plethora of benefits offered by it. It allowed people to connect in a very easy and economical way and changed this planet into a highly connected small village. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Many young people are interested in building a career in sports. To improve performance in their sports activity, sports persons are using drugs which are banned. To win the competition the athletes take this short cut and become famous. However, this kind of illegal activities should not be accepted. There must be stringent laws against the use of performance enhancement drugs. Every athlete must be tested medically before they perform on field. In the current competitive world of sports, sports professionals use banned substances like heroin, cocaine to enhance their performance on field. These drugs increase the energy in the body, increase the muscle power and endurance and improve breathing capacity. These benefits attract the athletes and they think this can be the best short cut to win the competition. By winning the game, athletes become famous. This lure of fame encourages them to use more and more drugs. However, this is an offence and athletes should not do this. Since events like Olympics are a celebration of human strength and endurance, taking these drugs defeat the very purpose of holding them. To prevent this kind of criminal activities, the board of the sports must have strict rules and regulations. An athlete with a history of doping must be banned from playing that game. Secondly, to prevent athletes from taking the drug before the event, they must be medically checked. Medical tests performed through exhaled air or an instant blood test before going on field can reduce the offensive activities of drug consumption. In conclusion, sports persons use drugs which are banned to improve their on-field performance. This is not a legal way to increase chances of winning the game.

"According to some people, during the hiring process the recruiter ought to look for the personal attributes of applicants instead of their experience and qualifications. I disagree with this viewpoint because a qualified candidate possesses the right skill set and insight which a non-qualified individual may lack despite having an amicable personality. Secondly, an experienced person could bring new technological advancement and has a lot to offer to the organisation. I will support my viewpoint in the subsequent paragraphs. First and foremost, a well-qualified person possesses the right skill set and knowledge required to land a job. As this is a world of specialisation, recruiters prefer to find / appoint a person with numerous skills instead of interpersonal qualities. For instance, corporates tend to hire only those individuals who attained their degree in a specific field as they feel that the person could perform better than a less-qualified individual. Furthermore, it is thought by some recruiters that an experienced candidate could give new technological progression to the organisation. All the methodologies and processes that an experienced employee brings with them help the firm to ameliorate their current business process to fetch more profits. For example, start-ups prefer to hire people who familiar with the business models of their competitors. Admittedly, people with pleasant personalities are good for handling clients. Personally I believe that personal attributes are crucial only in positions that require a lot of l interactions with the public. For back end jobs experience and academic qualifications are more important.  In conclusion, it is obvious that a degree-holder has the right skill sets and know-how to perform his duties better.

"Famous people live in the constant glare of media and fame brings with it both benefits and drawbacks. Even so, in my opinion, the advantages of being a well-known person outweigh the disadvantages.  The main problem of being a famous person is the excessive public and media attention. One of the biggest concerns of celebrities is the lack of privacy. They have a number of followers eager to peep into their personal lives and that encourages media to publish every bit and piece of their life. This can sometimes lead to problems because celebrities are normal people like everyone else and they cannot conduct themselves perfectly at all times. For instance, recently a famous actor expressed his discomfort when one of his fans attempted to take pictures with him during a marriage function. It became flash news immediately and people instantly jumped to the conclusion that he was an arrogant person who could not treat his followers well. Such incidents tarnish the image of celebrities and in order to avoid them, celebrities have to restrict themselves from behaving naturally in public and be extremely cautious all the time. On the flip side, there are many more advantages to being a celebrity. One of the biggest advantages of fame is that it opens the gate to wealth. National and international brands pay well-known people huge amounts of money to endorse their products. Celebrities also exert considerable influence on the society. Their followers listen to them and imitate them blindly. Celebrities can make a positive difference to the world by lending their support to various causes. Their fame and influence may even help them build a career in politics. Obviously, there are multiple advantages to being a celebrity.

"World population has increased greatly over the last few decades and industrialization has posed a major threat to wild species these days. While some argue that this trend cannot be stopped, others including myself believe that we still have time to tackle the issue. People who hold the opinion that we should accept the current situation base their argument on several reasons. To begin with, many places with serious environmental problems are already not suitable for some species to survive. For example, many wild animals lost their habitats because of deforestation and both water and air pollution brought by industrialization, especially in some developing countries. It is simply impractical to shut down these factories as some local governments give top priority to economic development. In addition, some problems are too complicated to be solved in a short period of time. Global warming is one of them. Some marine lives, for instance, are dying out because of increased temperature and there is nothing we can do to make a quick change. However, others believe that governments and individuals can still make efforts to save wild lives. Governments could introduce environmental laws to force factories to reduce carbon dioxide emissions that lead to global warming, and they can also impose green taxes on drivers to encourage people to drive less. As a result, less greenhouse gas emission from both factories and car use will lead to a better environment for both human and wild species. As for individuals, we can also limit our contribution to environmental damage by becoming more energy efficient. For instance, if paperless offices were widely encouraged and adopted, then there would be less demand for wood, and thus helping to curb deforestation and better protect wild habitats.   In my opinion, saving wild animals and plants can be quite challenging and will not be an easy task, but we still have time to take measures to change the situation. With the joint efforts of governments and individuals, environmental issues are likely to be at least mitigated.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"No doubt, parents play a crucial role in shaping the character of their children. Children imbibe both the good and the bad traits of their parents. Needless to say, kids coming from good families tend to behave well whereas those coming from bad or dysfunctional families are more likely to get into trouble. Since children are too young to understand what is right or wrong, it is the responsibility of parents to guide them in the right direction. Hence, I agree with the argument that parents should be held responsible for the actions of their minor children. Children have impressionable minds. They acquire their values and morals from their parents. For instance, kids born in a good family often listen to good words and moral stories from the elderly family members. Therefore, when they find themselves in a difficult or unfavourable situation, they know how to keep their emotions in check and behave politely. This restraint that they learn from their family will prevent them from acting aggressively and getting into trouble.  By contrast, a child coming from a bad family may assimilate the bad qualities of their parents. Since they often get exposed to verbal and physical abuse they will assume that violence and aggression are normal and acceptable. It is only a matter of time before they commit crimes outside the home. For example, in India, the mother of a 14 years old boy was penalized for allowing her son to drive a four wheeler. The boy caused an accident and the judge who heard the case held his mother responsible because in his opinion it was her duty to prevent her underage son from driving. Thus, obviously, parents are responsible for the actions of their children.  To conclude, after analysing the situation it is not hard to see that the role of parents in raising law abiding citizens with social commitment is of utmost importance. Hence, I believe that parents should be held accountable for the wrong acts of their children.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Some people believe that there should be fixed punishments for each type of crime. Others, however, argue that the circumstances of an individual crime, and the motivation for committing it should always be taken into account when deciding on the punishment. Discuss both views and give your opinion. With the alarming rise in crime rate, it is believed by some people that crimes should be categorised and accordingly punishments be pre-decided.  However, other people are of the opinion that all surrounding factors of committing a crime should be well considered before punishing the criminal. If the matter is viewed objectively, it is true that fixed punishments will take away a lot of wrong practices  from the judicial system. The judgements will be impartial, people will witness rather quick and fair decisions. For instance, many cases have been brought up by media where it is observed that the judge’s religious or personal beliefs impacted the severity of the punishments. Sometimes the punishments are too severe, and sometimes too liberal. Categorising and pre-deciding the punishments will make the system fair and impartial to a large extent. On the contrary, it is not just the responsibility of the judicial system to punish the criminals but to also help control the crime rates  to begin with. It is extremely crucial for the judicial system to understand the underlying cause that led to the crime in the first place. For instance, a crime involving murder for greed of money is different from the murder committed in an attempt to save oneself from getting killed. Evaluating the prevailing circumstances, the psychological health of the criminal, in his or her motivation behind the crime are all factors that cannot be marginalised. With all the different aspects mentioned above, I think that pre-deciding the punishments for a crime is not the most practical solution. It is more important to comprehend overall situation and let the judge analyse and decide upon a punishment that instils fear in the criminal for committing a crime again but at the same time does not prohibit them to live a normal life after completing their punishment.",7,False,58.05839480154549,353
"All over the world, high level positions are occupied by men. Some individuals opine that there should be a gender-based reservation for high profile jobs to give more opportunities to women. I entirely disagree with the view and have sufficient arguments to justify my stand. There are apparent reasons why reservation for high-end posts is not considered as a good idea. Firstly, it will create a sense of discrimination in the employees. If a woman is promoted to a CEO level post on the basis of her gender in spite of lacking the skills, other capable and deserving candidates will lose their motivation, and workforce may get divided into two segments which would be lead by two different genders. This is to say that this will not only deprive the deserving candidates of opportunities but also make them demoralized. Secondly, if women are given higher positions in the organization because of their gender and not skills, it can have detrimental impact on the performance of the organization. For example, The CEO of CloudTech Ltd. had got that position because of gender-based reservation in 2017. The company has recorded a decline of 50% in profits because of inappropriate policies and decision made by her due to the lack of capabilities and skills. Thus, it is evident that deserving candidates should be employed at the decision-making position; otherwise it can have adverse effects on the overall performance of the company.  To conclude, women reservation is not a viable solution to eliminate gender disparity existing in top-level jobs. Reservation may increase the number of women in managerial positions, but if they lack the required skills organizations will face loss. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is true that nowadays people in industrialised nations can expect to live longer than ever before. Although there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences to this trend, societies can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.As people live longer and the populations of developed countries grow older, several related problems can be anticipated. The main issue is that there will obviously be more people of retirement age who will be eligible to receive a pension. The proportion of younger, working adults will be smaller, and governments will therefore receive less money in taxes in relation to the size of the population. In other words, an ageing population will mean a greater tax burden  working adults. Further pressures will include a rise in the demand for healthcare, and the  adults will increasingly have to look after their elderly relatives.There are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Firstly, a simple solution would be to increase the retirement age for working adults, perhaps from 65 to 70. Nowadays, people of this age tend to be healthy enough to continue a productive working life. A second measure would be for governments to encourage immigration in order to increase the number of working adults who pay taxes. Finally, money from national budgets will need to be taken from other areas and spent  vital healthcare, accommodation and transport facilities for the rising numbers of senior citizens.In conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the populations of countries grow older.",8,False,77.92943159922929,257
"While a certain section of the society believes that commercials influence the buying decisions of consumers, others argue that public interest in promotions have declined because ads are everywhere. Although the reliability of infomercials is questionable, I still believe that advertisement encourages customers to purchase the recommended / suggested products or services. On the one hand, advertisements create awareness about the products by shouting out their features to potential consumers clients. In this era of globalization, when a huge variety of products are available, people become confused about what to buy. In this circumstance, we usually choose the product that we see many times in any format of advertisement, and in this way, unadvertised products remain unsold. For example, a cell phone market study shows that the Nokia Android phone failed in the market because of poor promotion when some other low quality brand sold more units by simply launching more promotions. On the other hand, we are now bombarded with advertisements. While some of those are relevant, others are irrelevant to us. So, it is impractical for buyers to concentrate on each of the commercials. So, they rely on the quality and like to research before making a purchase. For example, those who buy products online are more influenced by the reviews posted by other users than the ads shown by the company.  To summarize, we can state that the practice of choosing products on the basis of quality has become more popular among customers, but commercials have a vital role to play in presenting the product to potential clients. Finally, well-advertised goods attract more people and result in good sales, so promotions certainly motivate us to buy.",8,False,95.31883418093572,278
"The course of human civilization has had a devastating effect on the environment. Now we are facing problems such as – melting of glaciers, depletion of the ozone layer and Climate change to name a few. Environmentalists have been warning the governments and the general public over many years now but with no effect. People still have no regard for the indiscriminate use of coal derived fuels and wastage of water. This could be due to the lack of economical alternatives in the market or a feeling of apathy due to the extremeness of present lifestyle. We must encourage people to take part in the preservation of the environment by introducing safe, effective and economical alternatives and by government regulation.   Many citizens are aware of the environmental concerns from the exhaust from industries and vehicles. The dependence of today’s’ life on coal based fuels is extreme and has been developed over the past centuries. It will be time consuming and expensive to make a system change. Though many environmentally safe alternatives exist they are out of the reach of the common man. For example, battery operated cars are expensive and the networks of charging stations are still developing whereas, petrol and diesel filling stations with facilities are easily available. People can be encouraged to conserve energy by making the alternatives more accessible to all sections of society. Governments must support by companies developing environmental safe products and technology by offering incentives. Education is also an important factor, as the consumers today are busy and stressed and do not have the time to spend seeking out new products and methods of saving energy. In conclusion, we must become a more environmentally sound society so that our children will be able to inherit an inhabitable earth. This is our responsibility as parents and caregivers. It is unfortunate that we have neglected this for convenience and greed. Therefore all action must be taken to correct this environmental degradation. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In recent years gender equality in employment has been the topic of heated debate. While some may argue that women are less suited for certain jobs such as with the police or the military, I believe that female candidates should be treated the same as their male counterparts.Those who consider women to be unsuited for some kinds of jobs including the police or the military often hold that opinion because such jobs are extremely physically demanding. As the female body has smaller muscles and less physical strength compared to male body, women may have difficulty engaging in strenuous activity which can be exhausting even for men. In military service, female soldiers are more likely to struggle while defending themselves than their male peers when they are forced to move around carrying heavy firearms in the battle, which can increase their risk of mission failure. Because of the hazards and extreme conditions they may encounter, some people advocate that women are not suitable for work in these fields.Nevertheless, I believe that female applicants should be considered for police or military placements without a gender bias, because women are more suited to certain tasks. In the police service, female officers can perform important roles on some occasions such as a body search where male officers are restricted from touching female convicts. In the military service, female nursing staff are more likely to care better for injured soldiers since maternal instinct makes them dedicated and heart-warming professionals. Furthermore, for the sake of fairness to all, job seekers should have an equal opportunity to choose their jobs freely, regardless of gender. Many women have the desire to work in the police and the military and some of them have relevant expertise and qualifications. Therefore, they should not be discriminated against in employment opportunities for these jobs.In conclusion, although some say that women are incompatible with police and military duties because of the high physical demands, I believe that they should be treated as equal to men. This is because there are certain roles with the police and the military that are more suitable for women than men, and therefore both genders should have equal employment opportunities.",8,False,87.87529002320186,362
"The number of shopping centres in the cities is growing day by day. They have also started to appear in tier 2 cities and towns extensively. While a few people think these malls charge exorbitant prices for the products which can be bought in small shops at a much lower rate, there are others who contradict this view. According to them, shops in malls are the ideal places to go shopping. This essay examines both ideas and states my opinion. To commence with, the products and services offered by shopping complexes are costlier than those offered by local stores. That is mainly because malls have higher operating costs. Also, the government imposes higher taxes on the products sold in malls. In addition, these places are flooded with fancy lights, attractive mannequins and centralized air conditioning. They even play areas for children and snacks corners. All of these factors increase the prices. On the other hand, the glorious ambience of the shopping malls increases the prices but at the same time they contribute to a delightful shopping experience. They offer an extremely relaxing environment to shop at our ease and comfort. In addition to that, these outlets offer a plethora of choices from different brands all at one place and also in a more customer friendly manner. Lifestyle chain of stores, for example, showcases almost all brands of clothing in one place thus offering a lot of options to buyers. Sometimes these retail stores offer 30 to 40 percent discounts on many items which no other local shops can match. To conclude, though malls are expensive compared to other shops, the value they add to the shopping experience is highly appreciated. In my opinion, the expanding presence of such complexes serves as proof for their success and implies that these are the best venues to do shopping. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Fashion sense around the world is changing. In earlier times, people used to wear clothes as per their customs and beliefs, but these days, people all around the globe are following similar pattern while choosing clothes. In my opinion, it is a positive development. Firstly, when people from different backgrounds prefer similar clothing it is advantageous for the whole industry. This arrangement makes clothing more affordable because big manufacturers can produce them in abundance. This automatically cuts down the cost.  For instance, Levis, a well-known brand in the garments industry makes jeans and shirts in bulk quantity and sells them at a reduced price. By contrast, if they do not do mass production, their cost will increase, making clothes more expensive. Also clothes like jeans or trousers can be worn by people working in almost every sector whereas the ethnic wear of many countries can only be worn during certain formal occasions. For example, the Indian ethnic wear is not suitable for people working in factories or mines. What’s more, wearing similar clothes protect a person from many different kinds of discrimination. For example, Japanese and Chinese people wearing shirt and trousers will look exactly the same. Likewise there will be nothing to distinguish between an Indian, a Pakistani and an Afghani is they wore similar clothes. Obviously, if people wore similar clothing, it gives them an appearance of uniformity and equality. In conclusion, I firmly believe that the trend of wearing similar clothes is encouraging as it benefits both the individual and the economy.",8,False,78.82267441860465,255
"In the contemporary era, people are heavily influenced by the internet and social networking sites. Though this influence may be positive in terms of the virtual connectivity and better access to information, in my opinion, the internet and social media have a bigger negative impact. They make people inert and render age old traditions redundant. Of course, technological innovations have benefitted people in many ways. People today can connect with those living at far off places and interact with them with unprecedented convenience. In older days, it was almost impossible to talk with one’s kith and kin living in foreign countries in the event of an emergency. Furthermore, the internet and social networking sites facilitate dissemination of any news or information rapidly. Any event which is happening in one part of the world can be seen / watched by people at the same time throughout the globe. For instance, social networking sites such as YouTube present live coverage of any significant event throughout the world. Even so, in my opinion, the internet and social media make people lonely and unhealthy and render customs and traditions obsolete. I believe that Internet and social media encourage people to live in the virtual world and miss out on real personal interactions. This technology forces people to remain addicted to this form of social interaction. As a result, people avoid visiting parks, clubs and prefer solitude. This passive lifestyle gives rise to diseases such as hypertension, obesity etc. Furthermore, our age old traditions of greeting our family members and peers by visiting them physically have become obsolete. To illustrate, nowadays people send greetings on the birthdays of their family members and friends through Facebook. In conclusion, although the internet and the social media improve virtual connectivity and communication, I believe that this technology has negatively impacted the health of the people and our age old traditions.

"It is true that an increasing number of people are aware that environmental protection is essential to all people’s well-being. However, it is a pity that only a few people take measures to protect it.   The reason why most people do not work to protect the environment is that they are not willing to abandon the convenience and efficiency brought by some of high-end products, even though the widespread use of them can have detrimental effects on environment. For example, the excessive use of private cars in first-tier cities has led to an increase in the amount of carbon dioxide and other fumes emitted into the atmosphere. However, with more disposable money in people’s pockets, they still choose to buy brand new cars to drive to work or travel around, just immersing themselves in the convenience and privacy brought by owning a car and simply ignoring the negative effects on environment. Undoubtedly, everyone has an obligation to preserve the environment and there are tons of actions they can take. For instance, when a person sees a plastic bag flying in the air or wrapping papers lying on the ground, he or she can pick them up and put them in the nearby trash cans. Besides, people can lead an environmentally-friendly lifestyle by flying less, by using bicycles and public transport. More importantly, they can choose to vote for the politicians who propose to conserve the environment, rather than those who choose to ignore it. In conclusion, it is crucial for individuals to shoulder the responsibility and take some real measures to protect the environment. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In modern day society, education has become a vital aspect of every child’s life. Educational facilities tend to offer a wide range of subjects aimed at educating children and teaching them various skills. Fundamental subject areas are said to be mathematics, science, languages and physical education. Depending on the type of educational facility, a certain subject might be emphasised, yet these core subject areas are usually incorporated into nearly all educational facilities. Although it is commonly agreed that these subjects are vital for a child’s educational upbringing, opinions differ when it comes to the subject of music. Whilst some believe that musical education is an important part of growing up, others believe that it should no longer be taught in schools, as it is considered a waste of time and resources.Music falls under the subject area of art, causing it to often be considered as less valuable than other subjects. Typically people believe that learning to express oneself in a creative manner is less important than learning about mathematical theories and scientific facts. Often the opponents of musical education propose that a more rationally-based education will benefit children later on in their lives, as they will be able to perceive and comprehend the logical aspects of life more easily. The supporters of musical education argue that music is beneficial for children, because it offers a manner of creative self-expression. Furthermore, music is part of human culture, as it brings people together and therefore children who study music can obtain a sense of cultural knowledge.Personally I believe that music should be taught in schools and that it is not a waste of time and resources. I played piano for seven years and believe that this has helped me become a more balanced person. It is important for a child to learn about thinking creatively and to take a break from logical subjects once in a while.In conclusion, music should be taught at school, because it enables children to express themselves creatively and to learn more about culture and human interaction.",9,False,64.32307692307693,339
"In this age of globalization, many people leave their country to find better opportunities overseas. I am also thinking of moving to Canada in search of a better opportunity. Of course, this was not an easy decision and I considered quite a few things before deciding to migrate.  My first concern was the weather. I know Canada has extremely challenging weather. The winters are too cold and harsh and last year some cities recorded temperatures colder than the North Pole.  The second concern was the language. I am thinking of moving to Quebec province whose first language is French. Many people over there do not speak or understand English. One good thing about it is that the Government of Quebec encourages people to speak French and also run free classes for that. I am good at learning languages and my sincere belief is that I will be able to gain proficiency in French in a short period of time. In addition to this, another obstacle I am worried about is that I have never been on my own.  I am a family person and I have never been away from them so home sickness is my biggest fear. The main reason that encouraged me to take this decision is the shortage of skilled workforce in Canada. I know the country needs a lot of engineers, business analysts and the like and I fall under this category. With my skill set, it will not be difficult for me to find a good job there.  To conclude, I am excited as well as a little nervous about moving to a new country. On the bright side, I have weighed in all the pros and cons and I sincerely believe that this move will prove to be beneficial for me.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some people argue that schools spend too much time to teach subjects like history; in their opinion, it is more important to impart practical skills that can help students find good jobs in future. I completely agree with this opinion because learning skills that improve the job worthiness of students is far more important than learning history. First and foremost, studying these job-oriented skills helps students to be more confident in their fields. Consequently, they find it easy to get employed and perform well in their professions.  In other words, the more they learn, the more they can apply that knowledge to their practical life. For instance, courses that emphasise on practical or vocational skills better equip students for the workplace. By contrast, those who major in history have fewer job opportunities. While history is certainly essential to learn about our past, it is not a subject that prepares students for the workplace and as such it should not be given too much importance in the curriculum. Likewise, we are now living in an age where communication skills have become quite important. Still, very few schools focus on developing these skills. Consequently, when students enter the workplace they struggle to efficiently communicate with their teammates and this hurts their productivity. Obviously, teaching skills that make students more employable is far more important than teaching them about the past. To conclude, it is vital that educational institutions, especially high schools, add some skill learning courses into the curriculum and reduce the emphasis on subjects like history and geography because the ultimate aim of education is equipping students with skills required to earn a livelihood.

"Nowadays, we see that most of the children are busy playing computer games rather than engaging in any sports activities. The reason behind this situation is that personal computers are more affordable and a part of every household. Owing to this, children prefer to stay indoors and become engrossed in video games. The main reason behind young ones’ addiction to computer games is that desktops and laptops are inexpensive and many houses own one. Due to this, children squander away time by playing computer games as the graphical content is impressive. Moreover, parents do not bother about the screen time because they will not be disturbed as long as their children are hooked to the machine. As a result, young people develop addiction to computers and do not favour playing sports. They feel outdoor activities are tiring and require enormous physical efforts.  Spending a considerable amount of time playing computer games instead of sports is not good for children. This habit has harmful effects on their mental and physical health. Prolonged screen exposure will cause vision related issues alongside obesity because it does not involve any body movements. Another potential problem is depression which will lead to cognitive imbalance. When children spend long hours on the computer, they become isolated from the society/their peers. If a child is affected with such problems at an early age, their future is at stake. My neighbour’s child, for instance, is unable to concentrate on studies because of his addiction to computer games. In conclusion, affordability in the recent times has enabled many families to own a computer at home. Children rarely play outside as they are infinitely bound to these machines. This is certainly a negative trend because computer games addiction has detrimental effects on a child’s physical and mental well-being. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some argue that disturbing people by producing high levels of noise should be punishable by law, while others say that individuals should have the liberty to make any amount of noise. This essay agrees that punishment should be given to those who make abnormal amounts of noise. This essay will discuss both points of view. Legal action should be taken against those who generate extreme levels of noise. Loud noises can be very disturbing to neighbours, the general public and even animals. Certain people don’t bother about others getting disturbed due to them. In such cases, excessively loud noises should be made punishable. For example, in Denmark, hospitals follow a strict no-noise policy and a person can be heavily penalized by law if he makes too much noise. This has ensured the well-being of patients and visitors. However, some say that people should have the freedom to make as much noise as they like. It is wrong to assume that because every individual has a certain responsibility towards himself and others and must act in a way that does not harm anyone who is around him. They must be sensible and show empathy to others around them and this is their moral obligation. To illustrate, it is extremely inappropriate for a person to make too much noise in a funeral ceremony because it would show that he lacks empathy. He must, therefore, remain silent so that others do not get disturbed. In conclusion, making excessive noise should be punishable by law and no man should have the freedom to make as much noise as he likes. In my opinion, excessive noise should be a criminal offence to ensure that communities can co-exist peacefully.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"There are various ways to go about our lives. Some have preferences toward an organized life by following a fixed routine, whereas others pursue a life with more variations. I am in favour of a stable life; however, it can be monotonous. This life can be improved with some changes. On the one hand, some people prefer to lead a stable life. They desire more stability and efficiency. When people stick to a fixed schedule, they have the same pattern of life, which can bring more stability to their life. Also, when people live in accordance with a routine, they know what to expect next and they can prepare themselves for it. A considerable amount of time and efforts can be saved because they can reduce unnecessary trial and error for an unexpected situation. Thus, following a routine can boost people’s efficiency. However, when people adhere to old practices and routines, they can have a prosaic life, where any betterment is next to impossible. In order not to stay in a plateau, people have to accept some changes once in a while. On the other hand, others aim to have a more thrilling / adventurous life. They desire to have more variety in their life than stability and efficiency. Thus, they constantly challenge themselves and are willing to expose themselves to new options available. They are more likely to find their genuine interests through trial and accordingly they have improved chances of actualizing their desires.  In conclusion, I have more inclinations toward a stable life because of its comfortable nature; however, if a life is exceedingly dependent on a routine, it cannot get any better / there is little scope of progress.

"Almost every nation in the world spends a great deal of money on their top athletes so that they can perform well at international events like Olympics and bring laurels to the nation. Some people, therefore, opine that children should also me motivated to exercise by offering them money. I agree with this view. When children interested in sports and games are offered money, they will be able to buy the required sporting gear and exercise regularly.  To begin with, offering money to children to exercise gives them the necessary resources to procure their sports gear. Appropriate equipment allows them to perform at the highest level and reduce the risk of injuries. Consequently, children will be motivated to practice every day and that will boost their performance. In countries like China, Russia, Australia and the USA, they offer special grants to school children who are interested in sports to buy their favourite sports equipment during their High School years. Additionally, paying children to exercise is a great form of positive reinforcement for them. This way they feel highly encouraged to take up sports in schools and colleges. As a corollary of this they achieve a higher level of fitness. All these factors help the nations to produce highly talented and fit professional athletes for various top competitions.

"For finding an efficient candidate for a particular post, employers often consider interviews as the most reliable method; however, others believe that there are also many other important criteria based on which an appropriate employee can be chosen. I completely agree with the above statement as there are also other essential things to keep in mind before appointing anyone. To commence with, primarily the most important thing is the theoretical knowledge of the eligible candidate which can be judged by conducting a written test. The scores of this test will reveal whether the candidate has essential knowledge mandatory for that particular job. Moreover, sometimes theoretical intelligence is not sufficient so practical performance should also be tested to check the capacity of an individual. For instance, the computer proficiency of an applicant can only be measured through a practical test. So interviews cannot be solely considered as the best way for choosing a person for a job. Further reinforcing my views, previous work experience also plays an important role in perfecting the skills of an applicant. So quality and quantity of earlier experience would also be helpful to shortlist the eligible candidates from among several applicants. Besides this, for some specialized jobs, communication skill is essential for doing the work appropriately. To exemplify, customer service managers most efficiently interact with the customers to understand and resolve their problems. Apart from it, a medically ill person cannot give his best to his job so medical fitness test should also done before the appointment of a person.  To conclude, although interviews are important the employer must consider other effective / proven ways as well for choosing an appropriate person for any company or institute so as to produce a productive and motivated team of workers.

"In today’s world, people find more happiness in earning and spending money. Although it is true that we should get enough salary to earn a living, in my opinion, the tendency of wasting money for unnecessary things definitely does have detrimental effects on the individual and the society. By spending money on unnecessary items, an individual is doing himself more harm than good. For instance, a person working as an information technology professional might be used to an opulent lifestyle. He might find pleasure in purchasing smart phones and other electronic goods. However, if he does not have the habit of saving money, he will definitely run into trouble sooner or later. In other words, if an individual does not have interest in investing money, it will lead him to a financial crisis. Moreover, the extravagant lifestyle of an individual may influence those around him. Most probably, people become more selfish as they earn more and do not give attention to the family members and the poor people in the society. This situation, therefore, deteriorates the value of relationship and the significance of social harmony. In short, the habit of spending money unnecessarily, makes a person self-oriented, which in turn, negatively influences their dependents and other people in the society.

"Sample essay Computers have become an integral part of our lives. They are now used in almost all sectors like healthcare, education, administration and banking. In the future, these machines could even support human life. For example, they could be used as a substitute for certain organs. They already help surgeons in the operation theatre. In the future, they might perform the surgeries themselves. In my opinion, computers have improved our lives in myriad ways. However, over dependence on them will result in several problems. Computers have made our lives easier in numerous ways. They have increased our efficiency. They have made learning and teaching easier. They also allow us to communicate more efficiently.

In the future, computers will have greater applications in fields like education, healthcare and banking. I wouldn’t be surprised if someday they replaced human teachers or doctors. Unfortunately, computer technology has its shortcomings too. Online frauds are already costing nations billions of dollars. Increased use of computers will also lead to an increase in cybercrime. In the future, identity theft will create a lot more problems than it does now. Also, computers are machines that can breakdown at any time.

If recycling is made a legal requirement more and more people will definitely adopt that practice. There are certainly some people who will act only if they are bound by the law. There are also many people who do not require any laws. They only need access to recycling facilities. Therefore, in my opinion, before enacting a law, the government must build recycling units in all towns and villages. If people have easy access to recycling facilities, they have no reason to throw waste around. Actually, if we make a thorough analysis of this problem we can see that in many cities where garbage is a big problem, there is a dearth of recycling facilities. The government should also consider offering subsidies to families that want to build biogas plants to recycle their domestic waste. In addition, it can distribute compost bins for free. If there is a law and adequate recycling facilities in place, all people will certainly try to find a better use for their household waste. To conclude, enacting a law that makes recycling a legal requirement will certainly encourage more people to adopt this practice. However, before enforcing it by law, the government has to ensure that adequate facilities are in place.",9,False,76.79237288135593,322
"Nowadays, a significant amount of money is spent on the maintenance of old structures in many cities. Some people believe that the same amount may be utilized for other infrastructure projects instead of the above. I disagree with this view. In this essay, I shall explain why the budget to be spent for preserving and maintaining old buildings and monuments of cities should not be curtailed. The road side buildings in old cities are usually stone structures that represent the culture and heritage of that place. Many of them are in poor condition. Even so, in my opinion, they should be restored because these buildings are strongly attached to the history of the city. If they are demolished, a part of the history will also die out and it is a national loss. On the other hand, maintaining buildings of historical value in good condition is a great way to bring tourism to the city. The tourism generates new employment opportunities and revenue. A part of this revenue may be utilized for new infrastructure projects like better highway connectivity, new housing schemes etc. These infrastructure projects may also provide a hassle-free experience to the city tourists. For example, good metro train connectivity to the oldest part of heavily populated city will ensure better infrastructure and it will promote tourism as well. Having said that, those buildings that are beyond repair should definitely be demolished and new structures should be built in their place. Allowing them to stay in their dilapidated state poses serious threat to life and property. To conclude, old structures and monuments tell us about the history and time-journey of the city. Their maintenance and preservation shall enhance the reputation of the city and create employment opportunities and revenue. Even so, buildings that cannot be restored should be destroyed.

"Owing to the digitalization, these days, many activities are possible without any physical interactions. Although digital ways of shopping, working, and communicating are convenient and economical, in my opinion, their detrimental effects such as relationship conflicts and risk of fraudulence make them a negative development.  Undoubtedly, due to the surge in digital technology, people can now save time and money and lead a comfortable life. This is because of multiple reasons. Firstly, with the help of online shopping people can receive their favorite items at their doorsteps in no time with just a few clicks on mobile. As a result, they can save a huge expenditure on petrol consumed for supermarket trips. Secondly, communication has become quite easy and convenient due to the availability of applications such as Skype, WhatsApp, and many more, through which people can communicate with anyone without actually visiting their places. Moreover, digital advancement has benefitted the employees as well, as nowadays, many people work from home using the internet which provides them the comfort of working according to their schedule.  Despite the aforementioned advantages, I believe this is a negative trend due to its numerous drawbacks. Primarily, fewer face-to-face interactions tend to create social and personal differences. To exemplify, according to a study by Hopkins University, 40% of the people are likely to become socially aloof by the end of 2030, owing to the lack of interest in meeting others in person, caused by the huge influx in digital communication. Not only will this lead to issues with personal and social relationships, but it will also lead to people having issues within work because no facial interactions can easily create misunderstandings and conflicts with colleagues. Additionally, online shopping sometimes leads to fraud and misleads. Some fraudulent people hide the true identity of products while representing them online and mislead their customers with fake reviews and ratings.  In conclusion, while digital purchasing, employment, and interaction provide convenience and ease, in my perspective, these developments are more negative because they lead to social alienation and online scams.",8,False,103.26447313470662,338
"In a world with an ever-growing population, providing housing is one of the crucial tasks of all governments. At the same time, however, the environment has to be protected from too much destruction and deforestation. Different solutions have been created to solve these problems. One significant solution could be increasing the height of buildings.When looking at the skyline of metropolitan cities, skyscrapers are becoming increasingly visible. The reason for this is simple: housing has to be provided, while the environment should suffer the least amount possible. Decreasing the building footprints of houses and therefore the destruction of environment, while increasing the height, is an effective solution in overcoming this dilemma. This resolution also has its faults though, as increasing height also means that sunlight reaching the streets will decrease and that housing will be built more densely in order to save space.Another possible solution is to increase building costs to pressure the population into living in smaller areas, which would save space. As this impacts members of the community unevenly depending on their wealth, this would encourage unequal living standards and conflicts as a result of this. Therefore, this is not a plausible solution to the problem.In my opinion, finding the perfect way to minimise environmental damage while increasing housing is a problem to which there is no simple solution. Many governments are currently relying on height to solve the problem, but this is not attractive to many people. Any solution chosen should be one that causes the fewest problems.",9,False,64.77228303362003,250
"Nowadays, many children involved in different types of jobs to have some kind of financial assurance for themselves. However, whether this is good for their development and personality is a controversial issue. I personally believe that paid works is harmful for children for several reasons.It is said that children gain valuable experience in the work place. This may be true. However, I would argue that children are mainly employed in jobs that require manual work and are poorly paid. The recent statistics reveal the common tasks that children are assigned to are washing dishes, mopping floors or serving food in restaurants. Meanwhile, this kind of jobs actually  provide children with necessary and useful skills to apply in their future .This brings me to the second point. Defenders of child labour  that it is an effective method of learning. The point is children should be able to apply knowledge taught to them in a real life working environment. Although this is undoubtedly true, it also means that children may neglect the classroom study and even fail the class. The worst thing is yet to come. They may become so preoccupied with the benefits ahead of them such as small salary that they may leave school.Finally, supporters say that it helps them to build responsibility in the family. They will understand how it is difficult to earn money and therefore have compassion for their parents. This is true to a certain extent, but may have a totally adverse effect on children. As children can make money at an early age, they would feel that it is appropriate to spend it on luxury things.In conclusion, I think that parents should take measures to restrict their child from work, otherwise it would have negative consequences to their future.",7,False,75.04782923867525,294
"It is a contentious issue whether or not teacher training is essential for teachers. In my opinion, teachers have a major role to play and therefore they should be trained properly. Like every other skill, teaching skills can also be achieved through practice. Experienced teachers know how to capture the attention of their class by making their lessons interesting. They know how to control a class of 30 or 40 students coming from diverse backgrounds. Hence, the argument that teachers do not require any special training certainly holds some water.  However, it takes years to acquire experience. Actually, someone who just starts their career in teaching has no experience to rely on. And because of this lack of experience they may struggle in the initial years. This could hurt their morale and they may even start detesting their career. Since teachers are the ones who mould the future of our young generation, it is important for them to be qualified for their job from day one. They cannot wait for 10 or 15 years to acquire those invaluable teaching skills. Training courses impart those skills reasonably well. When aspiring teachers attend a training course, they get to know what they can expect from their job. This knowledge makes them better equipped to deal with the challenges of their profession.  In conclusion, although years of working as a teacher can help teachers develop essential teaching skills, any kind of deficiency can create problems. Hence, I believe that proper training is essential to become a good mentor.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"The last few years have experienced burgeoning growth in the field of communication technology and transportation, which enables people to work and live in any part of the world. In my opinion, it has lots of advantages when compared to minor drawbacks that it might bring. Despite the drawbacks mentioned below, I believe that advancement in communication technology and transportation offers definite perks. Firstly, it provides better employment opportunities and thereby helps in the amelioration of a person’s standard of living.  Consequently, their children also get access to better amenities so that the future generation is also benefited. Secondly, people around the world are brought together which paves the way for them to understand the world better. Distance is no more a barrier for people to reach their heights. Another point to consider is that when people flock to a certain place, to cater to their needs, there would be a development in the basic facilities.  Admittedly, when people work and settle abroad, it has some detrimental effects on the society. People seem to be ignorant of the cultural values and instead of serving their own country, they are swayed by the monetary benefits offered by the foreign country. If people move to various parts of the world, society as a whole becomes increasingly disjointed and fragmented. Moreover, instead of getting care from their grandparents, children of immigrant families are taken care of by baby sitters and after-school child care. To conclude, in my opinion, the benefits of getting employed and settling abroad eclipse the minor drawbacks it brings. People get not only better job opportunity, but also better standard of living with the improvement of communication technology and transportation.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is argued by some people that we have a lot more options to choose now than we used to have in the past. This essay completely agrees with the statement because thousands of products are displayed in shops at present and many people think it is difficult to select one from the multiple options.  Nowadays, we can find huge shopping malls which stock various products from many different brands and this sometimes makes it difficult for people to pick an item because there are so many options. For instance, about twenty years ago, when people wanted to buy clothes or electronic appliances there were not many options. As a result, they bought whatever was available to them and still they were happy. But today, the consumer is spoilt for choice when they enter a supermarket and as such they have to think many times before zeroing in on a particular product. Worse still, inspite of spending a lot of time comparing the options, they are not satisfied with the purchase because they suspect that the other options could have been better.  Choices are available in almost every area of life. For example, nowadays, there are plenty of options for higher studies and students and their parents often struggle to figure out what the right choice is. Even in the case of insurance and medical treatment choices are available in plenty. While the availability of choices is certainly good, the main disadvantage is that it makes the process of choosing difficult. To conclude, people these days certainly have so many choices that they often feel overwhelmed when they shop for something.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Advertisement is used as a key to increase the sales made by many popular firms worldwide. In my opinion, these companies can make their adverts fruitful by leveraging celebrities as their brand ambassador. However, advertising impacts people negatively by making them get in to debt. Powerful adverts can be made by hiring famous personalities to endorse the product. This is to say that, advertisements starring celebrities such as cinema artists or sports persons can easily reach general public. This is because people know them very well and tend to buy the products advertised by them. Another method of making effective advertising is creating adverts based on real life incidents or stories. For example, the popular Indian brand Amul often makes adverts inspired by sensational current events and thus manages to grab enough eyeballs.  However, advertising has a negative impact on the society as it encourages people to buy more products even if they are not in need of those items. Consequently, people tend to obtain more personal loans and stay in debt for life. For instance, the advertisement of sports cars tempts younger generation to buy them even if they cannot afford them. This will land them in serious financial difficulties. Moreover, it is annoying to watch repetitive advertisements while we watch our favorite program on television.  In conclusion, many giant companies increase their sales by advertising. They can make it more effective by using popular figures as their brand model and by making adverts based on real life incidents. Still, advertising is considered as disadvantageous as it makes people bound to debt and disturbs people when they watch some important program.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Most companies these days are driven by profit and fail to take care of the well-being of their employees. This newly emerged trend can severely damage the professional relationships between employers and employees, leading to disagreements which eventually hamper the work quality. Hence, all those companies that aim to be successful must look after their workers’ well-being first. Here are a few reasons why companies are chasing profit at the expense of employees and how it can be prevented in future.  In a country like India, even a mid-sized company faces hefty competition. In order to tackle this competition, they simply pressurize the employees to perform better. The situation is even worse in the private sector, where professional work laws are not implemented or lack enforcement. For example, there are media houses like NewsX, where most employees have to extend their regular work hours almost every day and work for about 11 hours in a day, in order to provide fast coverage of news.  There are a number of ways by which this problem can be resolved effectively. Enterprises must implement and follow robust employee friendly policies that allow fixed working hours, adequate leaves, flexible timings, etc. for a good work-life balance. Apart from this, they should offer great motivation either in the form of good appraisals or wages, or by extending other monetary perks. For example, a diamond merchant, Savji Dholakia gifted Rs 1 crore Mercedes car to some of his employees after they completed 25 years of service.   To sum up, companies need to opt for / adopt a more balanced approach towards employees instead of running after revenues. Since employees can determine the success and failure of the company, keeping them happy would eventually lead to success and business prosperity.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The central areas of many cities can now only be accessed by pedestrians. This essay will prove that this trend helps to improve mobility of people in centers; however, it also creates challenges for the businesses operating in centres. Without vehicles centres are easily accessible and the mobility of people increases. Centres of cities are supposed to be very crowded with people because most of the establishments within the city are located in these areas. The situation becomes even worse when vehicles are also allowed to enter these areas. Extreme traffic makes it very difficult to access town centres and this affects the business negatively. Unfortunately, not allowing vehicles in this area also affects downtown businesses negatively.   Most of businesses heavily rely on vehicles to receive goods from other areas of city. They also use these vehicles to deliver their goods to the addresses of customers. With a ban on vehicles, businesses find it very difficult to sustain their operations in traditional ways and they have to look for alternatives that are often not cost effective. This is the reason whenever a government decides to designate a centre as a pedestrian-only area, the decision faces immense resistance from the companies operating in these areas. In conclusion, although pedestrian-only centres can increase the mobility of people by eliminating the traffic caused by vehicles, they create problems for the companies operating in these areas. Because most of these companies rely on vehicles to transport goods, they are forced to arrange expensive alternatives when the vehicles are not allowed to enter the centres.

"News enables us to stay updated about the latest happenings around us and that is why it is so important to people all over the world. This essay discusses why media houses give undue coverage to bad news and why it is important for them to shift their attention to good news.   News keeps everyone updated on what is going on nearby and across the world. Hence people follow the news closely in order to keep themselves up to date of the new intentions and matters. News has also become important these days as it keeps us alerted. People know the kind of crimes that are happening in their surrounding and this helps them exercise extreme caution. These days many news channels aim to center their shows on bad news. This gives them multiple points to discuss which will increase their screen time on the TV. They have more content to debate and more material to air on their news channel. Sometimes these negative stories prove to be a source of entertainment to their audience. For example, there are many shows such as Crime Patrol which are meant to make the public cautious and safe. They became popular because of their thrilling plots high on action and suspense.  However, I believe good news should be broadcasted more as it brings the society closer. Good news cheers the mood of many people and makes them feel better. It also brings a lot of positivity to many sections of the society.

"Nowadays, computer and online games are extremely popular among students. Some people insist that children should be prohibited from playing these games at school because they do not serve any educational purpose. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, games should not be banned because they do offer certain benefits and some of them are educational. However, teachers should limit the amount of time children can play such games.  To begin with, young people are fascinated by electronic gadgets. They play games whenever they get an opportunity. This certainly is bad because playing online games for long hours affects the health and academic progress of students. Even so, banning them at school is not the solution because they do offer many benefits to students. Computer games help children unwind after a boring lecture or practical session. Nowadays, children are under tremendous academic pressure. They need a short break every few hours. If they are made to sit in the classroom for hours on end listening to lectures, their grades will only suffer. Asking them to play outside is possible only during favourable weather conditions. Inclement weather will confine kids to the classroom and during those times, online games provide them the much needed relaxation. Also, playing online games allows them to enhance their cognitive and problem solving skills. These games require a great deal of concentration and can actually boost the brain development of children when played in moderation.  However, it is important for teachers to limit the amount of time children get to play these games. Studies have shown that sitting in front of a computer or a console can cause eyestrain, headache and several other health problems. Also, excessive gaming may make children aloof and they may refuse to socialize with their peers, friends and neighbours. This will hurt their self confidence and also divert their attention from their studies. Hence, gaming should be permitted for only limited amounts of time.  In conclusion, online games educate and entertain kids; hence, they should not be banned at schools. However, it is important to limit the amount of time children can play online.

"Owing to the technological innovations that aid in solving the crime quickly, in the recent days people are witnessing a drastic reduction in the incidence of crime compared to the past .In my opinion I agree with this view as technology helps in saving time by enabling the sharing of information about offenders and by helping to monitor crimes that are about to happen.  There is no scepticism about the fact the recent advancements in the field of computer technology aids in the sharing of information at a rapid pace. What I mean is that digitalisation of the criminal records and other important data about crimes across the globe has enabled state authorities to track the offenders and maintain the law and order. To illustrate this, Interpol is an international organisation that maintains digital data about international drug cartel and mafia leaders which enables every state to trace such criminals without difficulty and thereby take action with sufficient evidence. Furthermore, technology certainly helps to prevent crimes that are about to happen. To be more precise, if people are aware of being monitored, not only will they obey the rules but also refuse to get involved in such crimes. A good example of this is that the installation of speed cameras with continuous monitoring facilities has curtailed the traffic crimes dramatically across major cities in India. Lastly, technology helps to control crime by raising awareness among the public. In other words ,police personnel use mass media and the internet not only as an effective medium to communicate but also to raise awareness about cybercriminals and their style of doing fraudulent activities. A clear example of this is the effective awareness campaign about online hackers which resulted in a drop in complaints related to stealing of personal banking information.  To sum up in my opinion I strongly contend that technical inventions definitely have a supplementary role in curbing crime by raising awareness and monitoring.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Children are overfond of toys and nowadays parents spend more money for buying toys for them. This certainly is beneficial for enhancing certain skills in teenagers; however, it isolates them completely from the real world. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of possessing loads of toys.  On the one hand, toys can be fun and educational. Having a wide variety of toys makes a child happier because it is the only form of entertainment that he enjoys as a kid. In addition to this, toys help to improve the memory skills and creativity of children. With the help of toys, children can learn quickly and they develop the ability of problem solving at a very young age. For example, toys like blocks help kids build their imagination and creativity and also make them understand the various shapes. Thus, owning a number of good toys definitely has a positive impact on children. On the other hand, spending more time with toys makes children create a fantasy world and they will not want to come out of it. They find it difficult to mingle with real people which makes them socially weak and they grow up as introverts. Furthermore, they fail to value things if there is always a replacement ready at hand. A recent research has shown that when kids have so many toys, they will naturally take less care of them.

Whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern, which incurs a highly-charged debate.Obviously, higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. For example,  higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly  it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by  most .

Technology has become a significant component of educating children and is considered beneficial in many ways. Nonetheless, there are likewise many disadvantages to using private technological equipment in classrooms.Bringing a private laptop to class offers a variety of benefits for students. Firstly, laptops can be used to take notes in classes where teachers sometimes speak at a high speed. Many children find that they can type faster than they can write by hand and therefore prefer typing their notes in class so as to not miss any important information. Teachers could furthermore make use of learning programs and websites during class, as students would have the possibility of using these websites on their private laptops. Moreover, students can use periods meant for working on assignments effectively, because they can work on their assignments digitally right away and not have to type up handmade notes later on. Information can additionally be distributed more easily to students, as for example hand-outs can simply be emailed or shared electronically and do not have to be printed.Although bringing private laptops to class offers these various advantages, it also creates several disadvantages. Laptops firstly are fairly expensive, meaning that families with more than one child will have to spend a large amount of money to purchase laptops for all their children. Furthermore, laptops can easily be damaged during class and outside of class as well as stolen, which could create future costs for families. During class laptops can also distract students, because they can surf the Internet or look at non-class-related work during class periods. The amount of time students are exposed to technological equipment is also increased by incorporating laptops into classrooms, which can result in several health-related problems.In conclusion, bringing a private laptop to class involves several advantages and disadvantages.

"Nowadays it is becoming increasingly common for youngsters to start their independent life by moving out of their parents’ home after graduation from school. This trend has positive effects on the society and the reasons behind it will be discussed next in this essay.There are various benefits for both young people and their parents when individuals start living independently after finishing school. Young adults, in this way, have to take care of their daily needs, from house chores, cooking or cleaning to financial independence. Thus, instead of wasting time on childish activities, they are motivated to learn skills and work part-time or full-time in order to cover their living expenses. Although it might seem challenging for them to live on their own at first, it would give them valuable experience, helping them to become mature, responsible adults. Parents would also be pleased with this practice since they can enjoy their own lives by having more time for themselves. Not only would they have more financial flexibility due to independence of their children, but they also don’t have to change their habits in order to adapt to the new generation’s lifestyle. For instance, it allows many people to travel around the world, which would be impossible if their children were to stay with them after finishing high school.Admittedly, there might be some challenges involved in this way of life. In some cases and especially under the influence of new friends or housemates, youngsters might choose to get involved in dangerous activities that involve drugs or petty crimes. However, instead of keeping their children close through adulthood, parents should prepare in advance and raise their children to distinguish between right and wrong and teach them to take responsibility for their actions.In conclusion, although there might be some adverse consequences to this relatively new practice, I believe that the advantages of young people leaving family home outweigh its drawbacks, for both children and parents.",8,False,107.0,321
"Nowadays an ever-increasing number of women work full time, and in this reality it is widely believed that house chores should be shared between men and women equally. I strongly agree with this statement.One of the reasons for sharing housework between  is to promote gender equality. A stereotype that has existed a long time is that females ought to stay home, taking care of the family once they got married. This includes looking after the children and doing all of the housework, which is fairly labour-intensive. However, this approach could have quite a few disadvantages. It would render women less able of keeping abreast of what is happening in the job market, thus forming a lifestyle where they might find it arduous to step into the society again. To avoid this, many women are willing to get back into the workforce soon after their maternity leave, and once they do, it makes sense that their husbands should share part of the household chores, to fulfill their family responsibilities.Nevertheless, we cannot be oblivious  several drawbacks of this trend. One potential downside is that men are less experienced in dealing with household tasks. This is because many seldom take an active role in doing housework, according to customs of many countries. As a result, they may end up doing household tasks in a less than perfect way, which could contribute to some unnecessary quarrels between partners, hindering their family bond. However, the likelihood of this happening isn’t very high, because wives can offer some tips or guidance to their husbands when they learn how to share house chores such as mopping floors or doing laundry.To sum up, although some conflicts might be triggered when equally sharing the duties of household tasks, the benefits of this trend are relatively oblivious.",8,False,104.42010797771525,297
"It is believed that the work time of staff should be reduced to 6 hours per day. While implementing this policy can prepare employees better for their personal lives, it is not practical. It is true that adopting such a policy is beneficial to workers’ health. It is widely acknowledged that the vast majority of employees suffer from exhaustion caused by the relatively long working hours, and do not have enough time and energy to play a sport. As a result, many of them lead sedentary lifestyles which make them prone to developing illnesses like high blood pressure and obesity.  Conversely, reducing their working time into 6 hours can alter this unhealthy life mode by enabling them to allocate some time for exercise.  However, implementing this policy will have more drawbacks.

"Over the years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of personal vehicles on roads. They have polluted the air and caused global warming. Some people argue that in order to solve this issue, the government should spend more money on public transportation; others opine that investing in electric cars is even better. In my opinion, investing in public transport is the best short term solution. A permanent solution is to adopt electric cars. There are many studies that suggest that investing in public transportation is better for society. To start with, it significantly reduces the number of cars on the road, which in turn translates to less traffic congestion and shorter time to reach destination. Travelling on public transportation, such as buses and trains increases the productivity of a person. People can work on their projects, assignments or invest this time in learning new skills. This time would have been wasted if they had chosen to drive a personal vehicle. Investing in mass transit also means creating new jobs for the community. Thus, not only does it improve the personal life of commuters but it also helps to create a thriving community. Spending money on the development of electric cars and other green alternatives, however, is not of any less significance. Electric cars have zero emission, which tremendously helps the planet. Significant investment in these types of vehicles is of utmost) priority, especially since we are now living on the brink of an environmental disaster). With such efforts, not only are we saving the planet, but we are also helping the human race as a whole. In my opinion, investing  in public transportation is  the current need of the society. Electric and other green vehicles are equally important but since their research and development are still in the nascent stage, it will be a while for them to become widely popular. They are not as affordable as their fossil fuel counterparts yet. If we invest in public transportation, we can realize the effects almost instantaneously. This will help the environment in the present and once electric vehicles become more popular and affordable they too will have a significant positive impact on the overall health of the planet.

"Some people believe that it is the responsibility of parents to teach the right values to their children, while others think that the main duty of parents is to provide children with a safe environment to grow up in. While teaching children the right values can teach them good behaviour, I believe that parenting children in a safe environment will help children to avoid negative behaviour. One the one hand, if children are taught the right discipline and values they tend to learn social behaviour. This is to say that children do not possess adequate knowledge about right and wrong behaviour and when kids are taught from a young age, they are more likely to behave well in their teenage. For example, a recent survey conducted by the American Bullying Association revealed that the kids who were taught moral values at home did not bully other kids in school. However, I believe that children’s age should also be taken into consideration while teaching them good behaviour. On the other hand, parenting and providing children a safe environment at home can avoid children from developing negative behaviour. In other words, when parents do not provide them a friendly environment they are more likely to develop anxiety and depression and this will cause them to develop aggressive and violent behaviour later on in life. For instance, a research study by The Guardian showed that 23% of the children in America developed some kind of violent and aggressive behaviour as they were brought up by divorced parents. I, therefore, believe that it is very important that children should have a good environment and proper parenting in their childhood. To conclude, although teaching discipline and right values can teach them social behaviour, I believe affectionate parenting and a friendly environment are more important as it will help children to avoid negative behaviour in life.

"It is true that multigenerational workplaces have become the norm in recent years. Despite their apparent disadvantages stemming from generational gaps, I believe that the advantages of this trend outweigh its drawbacks. On the one hand, there are many reasons why it is difficult to work in a multigenerational company. One primary reason is that since people from different age groups typically have different mindsets, it may be challenging to collaborate with a colleague who is at another stage of life. This issue might cause some conflicts within a team decision-making process. For example, young professionals tend to act quickly to seize the opportunities instead of deliberately think about the situation as senior employees do. Another reason is that experienced peers could discriminate trainees who are inexperienced. This results in unhealthy behaviors within the company, and it hinders the productivity of their team.  Nevertheless, honoring diversity in workplaces brings several gains for companies. Firstly, a diverse working group can observe a situation at multiple perspectives, which leads to meaningful discussions and solutions. In contrast, if all team members are at the same age, they might not realize the critical opinions of other age groups. Secondly, by maintaining employees of different ages, such companies can ensure a healthy talent and management pipeline at all levels and positions. Senior employees may mentor younger ones in order to develop their leadership skills, and managers are able to identify future leaders from such internal potential candidates. Finally, the companies will bring the best out of their people when they maintain harmony between professionals of all age groups within their workforce.  In conclusion, people should embrace the multi generations mix in today’s workplace because its benefits shadow the drawbacks mentioned above. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"There is a popular saying that the child is the father of nation. The mould provided to them when they are young is what they are likely to become. While some people opine that cooperative children make better adults than competitive children, I cannot fully agree with this view. Competitiveness cannot be omitted entirely and I consider it necessary to some extent.  Unfortunately, it has been brought out by various studies that there is a lack of empathy in this fast paced millennium.  Therefore, to overcome such a dreadful development, it has become mandatory now to instill the higher values such as a helping mentality, kindness and cooperation in our children. This would eventually help them to become better, compassionate adults and possibly enable/encourage them to serve the society for a greater cause. Moreover, cooperation is essential for the smooth functioning of our society. Furthermore, during a job interview, a candidate’s team spirit is assessed by making him go through certain group activities.  On the other hand, competitiveness acts as a propelling force which drives children to attain their goals as long as it is healthy. Enabling us to become a better version of ourselves at every step is one of the several pros of being competitive. Moreover, in this world of cutthroat competition, it is a necessary evil. For instance, in India, there are at least five hundred students competing for every single medical seat in a medical college. Without being competitive, it would be almost impossible to crack the exam. However, an excess of this quality may alter the personality and attitude of children in the long term. It may lead to unhealthy jealousy and features of type A personality making them more stressed out in due course. The need to win all the time may encourage them to adopt unethical practices like pulling others down by undue means.  To conclude, I reiterate that to shape our world into a better place, children must be conditioned to become more compassionate and cooperative. However, a healthy competitiveness should also be encouraged so that it keeps them motivated to do better. The holistic approach would be to instill both the qualities proportionately to shape a child into a wholesome individual.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"There are many people who think that a sportsperson can only be successful if they have innate talent / inborn talent. However, many people disagree with this view and believe that diligent efforts and constant practice make successful players. This essay will discuss both views and give my perspective. On the one side of the argument, many people believe that natural talent is needed to be a successful sports player. The main reason behind this is that genes from parents play an important role in the development of a person’s body and interests which help them to master the game with less effort. To illustrate, the daughter of the famous Indian badminton coach, Mr. Gopichand started playing badminton at an early age of her life. She has won many medals at the national and international level. Obviously / No doubt, having natural ability can help a sports person to be successful as they can easily learn the sports and put efforts in an effective manner. On the other hand, many people think that hard-work and constant practice can help any sportsperson to achieve desired outcomes. The primary reason for believing this is that a game is played with passion and dedication. If a player has these two qualities then they can learn all the required skills and reach great heights. Although hard work can be frustrating at times, it also sharpens the skills and strengthens the player to focus more. To elucidate, Sachin Tendulkar, the renowned cricket player worked industriously for decades to earn the title of best player across the globe in the field of cricket. Hence, practice and hard work play a greater role than natural talent in making a sports person successful. To conclude, after analyzing both the sides, it is not hard to see why people hold different opinions. In my opinion, a player can only be successful in a game if they have a strong will to achieve their goals through hard work and dedicated efforts. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to a section of the society, the retirement age should be increased due to the increasing lifespan of the people. I strongly disagree with this opinion because in my opinion just because people are living longer it does not mean that they can or should work beyond a certain age. Also, during their twilight years, their priority should be spending more time with their family and taking care of their health. In this essay, I will defend my perspective with valid arguments. One of the logical reasons for not increasing the retirement age is that people work hard throughout their regular working life and they hardly get enough time for vacations and family gatherings. Considering this, during the later stage of their life, they must be given an opportunity to relax and spend enough time with their children. For example, this concept is very common in Asian countries, where most elderly people retire early and they only manage family affairs after retirement. Another argument in support of not increasing the retirement age is that older people require sufficient medical care. Most of the people have diseases like blood pressure and heart problems, which require significant healthcare. Therefore, it is very tough for them to face the work pressure at the workplace.  For instance, recently in our office one of the older workers died because of heart attack and his medical examination revealed that the cause of his death was excessive work pressure. In conclusion, I reiterate that retirement age should not be increased. This is because people should give maximum time to their families in the later part of their life. Also, at this age caring for their health is more important than working. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The functioning of businesses has changed drastically over the past few years and so does the recruitment process. Some believe that the best approach is interviewing the potential employees while others have arguments against this method or practice. In my opinion, job interviews along with initial training are the most effective methods. Generally, the recruiters hire the candidates by interviewing them about their personal and professional life. This helps them to create a first impression about the applicant. Also, this method gives the employers a great opportunity to test the knowledge and problem solving skills of the future employees. However, this approach is often considered as an unreliable one due to the fact that the competencies of a person cannot be evaluated in one meeting. Moreover, it sometimes leads to biased decisions. For example, it is commonly seen that interviewers are more inclined towards candidates that have the same opinion as them and may even reject other skilled interviewees. On the other side, there are also other approaches that a human resource department may consider while selecting employees. This includes initial training and performance evaluation before hiring an applicant. This will not only enable the organisation to evaluate the conceptual and technical skills but also help the prospective employee to understand their culture and work environment. For instance, most behavioural science organisations train and test their applicants to evaluate their capabilities. Thus, there are numerous approaches to choose the best match for the job position. I believe that rather than just interviewing the individual, a recruiter should always employ methods that will also examine the candidate’s compatibility with the organisation by conducting performance evaluation tests.",8,False,97.85532712991558,275
"The issue that people waste food has become increasingly serious these years in many nations. In my opinion, people’s lack of awareness is the main cause of this problem, and if governments take effective measures, this situation will probably be improved.  Thanks to the development of farming methods, the price of food has significantly reduced and become highly affordable to most ordinary people. When eating / dining in shops and restaurants, many individuals tend to order more food than they need. However, only a small proportion of them develop the habit of packing the leftover if they cannot finish the meal. As a result, it is quite common to see that many dishes are left unfinished and end up in rubbish bins eventually. In Shanghai, for example, the amount of food dumped annually is worth a stunning / a staggering 1.4 million dollars which could feed thousands of people living in poverty in Africa.  I believe that governments have a tremendous role to play in reversing this situation. The significant measure authorities should implement is to enhance the public awareness of the importance of saving grains. This can be done through various means ranging from distributing flyers among communities to playing public interest advertisements on TV. Regarding the content, since most consumers take food for granted, it could include the fact that there are a multitude of people dying from starvation in certain developing countries. In this way, individuals are likely to become more conscious of the fact that they are fortunate to have enough to eat and hopefully change their habit of wasting food when dining in restaurants.   In conclusion, it seems to me that lack of awareness is the major contributor to people’s food wasting behavior nowadays, but this problem can be addressed to a great extent if / provided that the government invests in educating its people.

"According to some people, dangerous sports should be banned because they pose a threat to the lives of people who participate in them. However, others feel that adventurous sport is a part of recreational activities and hence it should not be banned. I agree with this view to a great extent. In my opinion, participating in adventurous sports is an opportunity for people to conquer their fears and discover latent talents. However, people who indulge in such sports should receive proper training and supervision to reduce the risks.  Young people are keen to explore new things and conquer their fears, so they participate in risky sporting events such as skiing, water rafting and bull fighting. They are driven by the adrenaline rush they get to experience while engaging in such activities. However, they are putting their lives at risk. For example, in white water rafting, the inflatable rafts may overturn and the player can fall into the river or even drown. Likewise, in bungee jumping the equipment may malfunction leading to the untimely death of the participant.  Having said that, banning such sports is not the solution. To start with, adventure tourism is a booming industry and makes significant contributions to the economy of many nations. Banning such activities will ultimately prove to be detrimental to them. A better solution is to ensure that such sporting events are performed under expert supervision. Only licensed organizers should be allowed to conduct such activities. In addition, the participants should be made to undergo proper training. If adequate security measures are taken, it is possible to play adventure sports safely.  In conclusion, dangerous sports should not be banned but those who are passionate about such sports should be trained properly to mitigate the fatal injuries and deaths.

"The increase in the number of accidents on roads has become a matter of concern for people at large. Many people opine that strict punishments should be given for traffic violations. I agree with this opinion to a certain extent. In my opinion, some other measures should also be taken along with stricter punishments to solve this problem / to make our roads safer. Our law has already defined some penalties for minor mistakes and suspension or cancellation of licence for major offences. Imprisonment is also given for serious and fatal accidents. For example, in 2004, the Indian government enacted laws that impose rigid penalties on people who drink and drive. This actually led to the reduction of drunken driving cases. Though / although the strict laws seem to deter a lot of offenders, many people still violate traffic rules. Obviously, some other initiatives need to be taken along with these strict laws. Firstly, the government should start some awareness campaigns to make people aware of the devastating consequences of the traffic offences. Secondly, more surveillance cameras should be installed on the roads because the fear of everything being recorded might force some people to follow rules. Last but not least, driving licenses should be given to people only after complete scrutiny of their driving skills. This is not exactly the case in many countries where aspirants can bribe officials and get the licence issued to them. To sum up, in my opinion, strict punishments alone are not sufficient. Some other measures too should be taken to reduce accidents.",8,False,97.02807337589945,256
"Thanks to technological innovations such as the internet, wireless telephony and faster modes of transport, people can now live and work in any part of the globe. In my opinion, the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages.  There are certainly many benefits to being able to live and work anywhere. First of all, people have more choices of jobs because of technological advances. Not only can they work from any part of their home country, but they can also work for any company in any part of the world through telecommuting. Gone are the days when people had to be physically present in the office to be able to work. Now from the comfort of their home, they can serve clients living in other continents. Modern wireless technology has also made work easier and created more time for self and family. Better still, people can lessen their work hours and still accomplish their tasks more efficiently and with less effort. The transport sector has also seen revolutionary changes. Thanks to services like metro, the travel time has reduced considerably. This has also enabled people living in the countryside to work in cities. Earlier people had to move to cities to find employment there. Now they can live in the serene countryside and still have a flourishing career in the city. This has decreased the overcrowding of cities and made them more livable. Of course, there are some downsides to being able to live and work anywhere. This flexibility and convenience has actually made people physically inactive and led to some health problems. In addition, it has made people dependent on technology. Actually, life now comes to a standstill in the event of a network failure or system breakdown. Nevertheless, these minor drawbacks are negligible when we consider the benefits.

"It is indeed true that video cameras are increasing being used in many metropolitan cities to deter crime. While I accept that surveillance cameras invade our privacy, in my opinion, the benefits of using them to improve security undoubtedly outweigh the demerits. The installation of video cameras at public places certainly leads to the invasion of privacy. They capture each and every moment and as such people who are aware of their presence often feel forced to make a conscious effort to conduct themselves respectably when they access public places. While this is not a major issue, it can certainly be a nuisance at times. Even so, I would argue that the benefits derived from deploying video cameras at public places are more pronounced than the limitations. Firstly, they make public places safer by reducing or even preventing criminal activities. This is because being under the constant surveillance of video cameras deters both amateur and seasoned criminals from committing crimes. They understand that they are being watched and this stops them from doing anything illegal. For example, New Zealand, which is one of the most peaceful nations in the world, has considerably reduced the crime rate during night by installing video cameras at all public places. Of course, increasing police patrolling of streets may also help to reduce crime, but cameras have an advantage over human law keepers. Unlike a human police officer, a surveillance camera will not fall asleep or develop fatigue while on duty.   In conclusion, the advantages of utilizing / installing video cameras to enhance security at public places certainly outweigh the disadvantages.        After all, safety is more important than privacy.

"Personal and public health are tightly related to food choices. While some people believe that the government should regulate nutrition to improve public wellness, others argue that it should be people’s decision whether to pursue a healthy diet or not. This essay will discuss both points of view and explain why the authorities should not control the types of food people can buy.Legislators could impose laws concerning nutritious food in an effort to have a healthier population,  public health costs. Even if this could be considered a good idea, it would be very quite difficult to implement. To achieve this target, the rulers could impose a levy on unhealthy food options, or reduce their availability on the grocery stores shelves. In Italy, for example, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed. As a result, the sales of these items have decreased. However, if the authorities start to take control of what their citizens can or cannot eat, it may be seen as limitation of freedom.Since personal freedom is an extremely important human right, many people think that they should be responsible for their choices regarding the food and drinks they decide to consume. I agree with this opinion because limiting nutritional options, even if it is done with the best outcome in mind, could consequently create dissatisfaction among the population, which would possibly lead to other public issues such as protests and demonstrations. A better approach could be educating the public about a healthy diet, which would help people make better-informed decisions about the food they consume. Many developed countries around the world employed this strategy and saw public health gains.In conclusion, even though the government is able to control the dietary habits of its population through taxation and restrictions, healthier citizens and reduced public health expenses isn’t the only possible outcome. Limiting personal freedom could result in social unrest and for that reason diet decisions are better to be left up to well-informed individuals.",8,False,113.88806957902077,329
"To survive in this competitive world, educational success matters a lot. To gain this excellence, both the tutor and the student need to pitch in their efforts. A good teacher is necessary to impart education because / for they know how to teach lessons and keep the interests of the students alive. Their own knowledge about the subject has to be good enough for them to be in a position to enlighten any student. They need to have the patience to deal with their students.

In conclusion, a teacher’s expertise and a student’s enthusiasm are both important for the student to achieve academic brilliance. Even so, in my opinion, the student’s attitude towards learning and his insatiable quest for knowledge are the more important of these two factors because if one teacher is bad, the student has the option of finding a better teacher elsewhere.

"Supermarkets are gaining huge popularity in certain countries and local businesses are finding it difficult to compete with them. Some people have the opinion that the end of local businesses can lead to the death of local communities. I disagree with this statement because of the reasons described in this essay. Many new supermarkets and shopping malls are emerging in many places. It is difficult for small businesses in local areas to compete with these kinds of large businesses. There are several reasons for this. Firstly, beautiful architecture, ambience and other facilities such as car parking attract many people towards supermarkets. Shopping is no longer just buying things, but it is also a kind of entertainment for people in the modern society. Secondly, supermarkets make shopping easy for people as they can buy all the items which are necessary from one shop. Going to different shops for getting different items is tedious and time consuming. However, closure of local businesses will not lead to the death of a community. People live happily in localities even if local shops are not available. As a result of the growth of technology and global economy, people now have enough money and transportation facilities to travel to big markets in distant places. Therefore it is not necessary for them to depend on nearby local shops to meet their needs. For example, metro trains which can take people faster to shopping malls are now available. In conclusion, I disagree with the opinion that the closure of local shops can lead to the death of local communities.",7,False,70.89440186148371,261
"Some say that these days we have a lot of choices. I somewhat disagree with this statement. Having choices is subjective if we consider the whole world. It depends upon the place you live in. For instance, someone living in the developed world like North America or Europe or even in a developing country like India, Indonesia or Thailand, has a lot of choices for everything. On the contrary, someone living in a dictatorship like North Korea or a communist country like China has limited options. In communist countries the governments often regulate what the citizens can do and what services they can use. For example, a lot of applications that we use on a daily basis like Gmail, Google Search and Facebook are banned in China. This limits the options available for their citizens and forces them to use whatever services provided or approved by their governments. Similarly, in North Korea, people can only have a specific kind of hairstyle. There are very few options available from which people have to choose one. In religious and authoritarian countries in the Middle East, women have no choice regarding the dresses they can wear outdoors. It all sounds preposterous; however, this does not mean that people living in these places are unhappy about the lack of choice. In democratic countries, on the other hand, people have many choices. There are many different kinds of clothes that they can wear. They can even get a variety of cuisines from all over the world to satisfy their cravings. A lot of options are available when they want to buy a new car or a mobile phone, which is a good thing as offering choices to the customer increases the competition and thus speeds up innovation. However, having a lot of choices can be tricky sometimes. For example, when someone has to select an insurance policy or decide where to invest his money, having fewer choices is better. In such situations, having lots of choices creates confusions and can cloud the person’s judgement. So, people approach financial advisors, but sometimes these advisors recommend only those options that are profitable for them and this in turn limits the choices the customer can have. In conclusion, I feel that having or not having choices is subject to many factors like where a person lives, what situation they are in, what their beliefs are and so on. Therefore, I somewhat disagree with the generalized statement that people these days have a lot of choices.",8,False,72.2484886649874,417
"Today, technology has become an essential part of our work and life so much so that there is a dramatic increase in the number of tasks performed by robots. In my perspective, there are several economic and sociological reasons behind this positive development. Firstly, people’s lifestyle has become more dynamic and demanding. That means people need to study and work more to achieve their progressive objectives.  Consequently, people are relying more and more on technology to do the basic tasks such as house cleaning and food preparation. For example, the number of people in the USA who use cleaning robots such as ROMBA are rapidly increasing due to the abundant time savings. Hence, by using advanced technologies people can save time for working or studying and achieve their big goals. Secondly, this demanding lifestyle has pushed people far from their families; which, in turn, afflicted their social connections due to the shortage of free time.

Undoubtedly, that utilization of technology improves people’s social life significantly and invigorates their business networks. Thus, the usage of robots at  work and home enables people to save time and use it for other more fulfilling tasks. To sum up, advanced technology has reached people’s work and homes. This great development makes their life more comfortable and stimulates them to focus on their goals while robots do their daily tasks.

"Nowadays, the popularity of dangerous sports has increased. Many a time playing adventure sports leads to serious injuries and even loss of life. Some people argue that risky sports should be banned. I completely agree with this view. The vast majority of people participating in adventure sports are youngsters. They are driven by adrenaline and do not always manage to comprehend the risks. They just seek the thrill. Playing an adventure sport like white water rafting or paragliding might help them conquer their fears or discover new talents. Unfortunately, such activities are dangerous. A mishap may incapacitate the participant for life or claim their life. To give an example, one of my very close friends lost his left leg due to misbalance while landing from Paragliding in Nepal last year. Such incidents are the loss of one person and a lesson for others. While one can argue that people participating in such events are aware of the risks, nobody is supposed to willingly put their life in danger. Life is a gift. Of course, everyone wants to live it to the fullest but this should not be done by exposing ourselves to avoidable risks. Another argument in favour of banning such sports is that the ban saves public money. Oftentimes, the government is forced to launch rescue operations when players go missing or find themselves in dangerous situations. Such operations are expensive and could be avoided if adventure sport is banned.  To conclude, everyone has the right to play a sport they enjoy; however, nobody should be allowed to throw themselves into danger. Hence, in my opinion, dangerous sports should be banned.

Therefore, it is often argued by many people that much of the learning should happen in the school and the students should not be burdened with home assignments. However, there are many others who disagree with this view; they think that homework is a crucial part of their child’s overall education. In my opinion, young students should not be given any homework because they need time to play once they reach home. However, older students should be given homework because they have to revise their lessons every day to achieve good grades.  On the one hand, many parents feel that homework is an extra burden that has been put on their child’s shoulder. In their opinion, children should be taught everything in school so that they can play or rest when they reach home.  If students have no homework to complete, they can focus more on some sports which they could take up as a hobby or even as a career option. Or they can just play around with other kids and spend time with their families which would contribute to their overall personality development. On the other hand, certain parents think that homework plays a vital role in the academics of their children. According to them, homework serves as a revision of the class work which helps the child to understand the topic better. It also gives them an additional practice of the lesson taught to them in the school. This, in fact, reduces the exam stress considerably as the student has practiced the lessons multiple times.  To sum up, it is said that too much of anything is bad; hence there should be a balance maintained in terms of homework given to a student. Schools should come up with a timetable which could allow students to focus more on studies in school so that they can focus on other activities after school.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some people opine that it is better to make friends with people who share their likes and interests. Others opine that it is nice to have a friend who sometimes opposes their views.  In my opinion, having friends who disagree with us on some topics can give us a better perspective of the situation we are in.  There are certainly several benefits to having a friend who agrees with us on most things. For example, friends with similar interests can watch a movie or plan an outing together. Since they have same tastes, there are fewer chances of conflicts between them. In this day and age when most people have stressful jobs, being in a stress free friendship is essential to save our sanity. On the other hand, a friend who always agrees with us on all topics can sometimes do us more harm than good. Every one of us has our shortcomings and all of us make mistakes. If all of our friends always think like us, there will be no one to guide us to the right path when we go astray. For example, someone may be addicted to the nasty habit of smoking. He is more likely to choose friends who share the same liking for tobacco. Unfortunately, this does not help him in any way. As time passes by, his addiction to smoking will become more and more intense and he will develop various health problems. By contrast, if he had a friend who did not smoke, he is more likely to have quit this deadly habit years ago. Thus, it is evident that sometimes friends with dissimilar interests and views can be beneficial to us. In conclusion, having friends who agree with us certainly makes our lives less stressful. However, it is essential to have at least a few friends who do not think like us because they can give us better perspectives on life.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Exercise is the key to a healthy lifestyle. Working out is believed to be the most effective way to keep growing children and youngsters healthy. Some people, therefore, propose that physical training and playing outdoor games such as cricket, football, basketball and etc. should be made a compulsory part of the school curriculum. I completely agree with this idea that sport and games should be mandatory in educational institutions. To begin with, sports help inculcate teamwork among pupils. By participating in different physical activities students will not only have fun but also learn a great deal about coordinating amongst team members. To illustrate, in a game of football, team members cannot play their own game; rather each one should play as a team to win the game. Therefore it is vital for students to participate in such games to have a better understanding of team dynamics. Furthermore, physical activities such as going to the gym and yoga classes can help adolescents get rid of their sedentary lifestyle. Going out and playing in the open will improve their health whereas staying indoors all the time can make them lethargic. According to a recent study conducted by Cambridge University students who play outdoors enjoy better physical and mental health than those who are glued to their television sets and videogames. Thus it is imperative for youngsters to go out and play to improve their overall health. To recapitulate, this essay has discussed how physical activities can inculcate a healthy lifestyle in children and the youth. Therefore, I strongly recommend that outdoor activities be made compulsory in educational institutions.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The following is an essay submitted by one of our students. Throughout the human history education has been considered as one of the key components of success in life. However, everything is good in balance and education is not an exception. Thus, I disagree with the belief that pushing kids to study at their spare time would be extremely beneficial for them. Some philosophers say that education kills imagination. When a person starts gathering new information from different books and lectures, they use a material that has already been explored by someone else. As we know, childhood tend to be one of the most adventurous moments when everything is new and unexplained. If kids are forced to spend all of their time on studies, they will not have enough time for explorations. In addition, there are numerous facts that prove that a human brain is capable of memorizing a certain amount of information, when the limit is reached people stop understanding and memorizing any new material. Therefore, it is essential to give our brain a rest from time to time in order to maintain the ability to receive and analyse new information. Otherwise, any education will be simply a waste of time and money. To recapitulate, it is necessary to say that childhood is a unique and unforgettable moment of our lives. Most importantly, by overfilling it with books, studies, and schools parents do not help their kids to become future great philosophers and thinkers. On the contrary, they prevent them from developing a creative mindset that is so important in fields such as entrepreneurship, art, and science.",7,False,97.9721720547321,268
"Some people opine that in order to stay fit, it is essential to join a health club. Others insist that doing everyday activities and going for a walk or jog should be enough. In my opinion, it depends on the fitness goals of the person. If staying healthy and having a reasonably attractive frame is the goal, leading a physically active lifestyle is enough. However, hitting the gym is the only option if a person wants to stay healthy and achieve that perfect body with washboard abs. Whether or not a person should join a fitness centre depends on their fitness goals. These days, a lot of people are conscious of their body. They get inspired by models and athletes and want to have perfect bodies like theirs. It is not possible to achieve this without joining a gymnasium and making adequate changes to the lifestyle and dietary habits. The perfect body with zero fat is not a natural phenomenon and as such it is not possible to achieve it by doing everyday activities alone. On the other hand, if a person only wants to stay healthy and eliminate excess body fat, they do not really have to work out every day. Walking to the bus stop, taking the stairs of the office and doing errands on foot will burn the excess calories and help them to stay in shape. A lot of people actually have physically demanding jobs. For example, door to door salesmen have to do a lot of walking. Likewise, some jobs involve the lifting of weights. People who engage in such jobs are unlikely to have to do anything extra to achieve fitness. In conclusion, joining a fitness studio is not mandatory for everyone who wants to be healthy. However, if their requirement is to achieve body transformation, intense workouts and proper supervision is a must and they will have to join a gym. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some people opine that home appliances like washing machines and dishwashers and communication tools like the internet and smart phones make our lives more complicated and elevate our stress levels. I do not agree with this view. While I do admit that overdependence on technology might lead to unexpected situations and increased stress, judicious use of technology will certainly reduce our stress levels by making our lives easier. To begin with, time is the most precious commodity in this world. Generally speaking, any technology that saves time is beneficial for us. Modern innovations like emails and the internet make communication superfast and thus save a lot of time which can be used for more productive things. For example, these days technology has enabled many people to work from home. This allows them to save precious time which would otherwise have been consumed by the daily commute. They can use that time to build better relationships or to cultivate a hobby. Studies have shown that people who have time for themselves and their family tend to have considerably low levels of stress.  In addition to that, the labour saving devices significantly reduce the amount of energy and effort required to perform tasks. Consequently both individuals and businesses are able to get more work done in less time and with less effort. This conserves their energy which they can use for playing a sport or doing some other tasks that they enjoy. For example, if people have sufficiently higher levels of energy even after completing the day’s work, they can perhaps go for walk in the evening or do some gardening. Both activities will refresh their mind and benefit their physical health.  On the flip side, excessive use of technology and overdependence on it can certainly be problematic. For example, these days due to social media addiction most people have an uncontrollable need to stay connected to the internet all the time. If they lose connectivity even for a few minutes, their stress levels peak. The misuse and abuse of technology also lead to many problems. However, these issues can be resolved by using technology only for the intended purpose.       To conclude, even though new-age scientific inventions create dependency and unexpected problems, if they are used moderately and wisely they will definitely reduce our stress levels.  ",9,False,91.43726235741445,384
"In Britain, the government pays for the nursing care of the sick and old in an Old age Home. While the government should undertake the responsibility to provide infrastructure, I believe, the family should also contribute towards the expenses to run them. The nations should take care of its citizens not only when they are young and able but also when they grow old and need someone to take care of them. When they are young, the people pay various taxes and make contributions towards pension and social security funds. These retirement savings are to be utilized for the medical care of the old citizens. As people grow old, they are in need of more money to be spent on their health upkeep. Unfortunately, this is the time when they do not have enough savings to support such expenses. As a result, they take shelter in old age homes during such situations.  Britain is a country of broken families. Families should take care of their loved ones whether they are young or old. However, in changing times, because of divorce and other attenuating circumstances, many families have lost cohesion and individuals prefer to stay separate due to discords and irreparable relations. The children of such families are not able to take care of their parents due to lack of bonding or sometimes also, because of economic situations. As a result, the family members have to be moved to the nursing care of the facility provided by the government bodies. Parents take care of their kids, so children have a responsibility to take care of their parents when they are old and feeble. So, they should contribute financially for them, even if they cannot personally be available for them. I think if affordability is not an issue, the family members should pay for the nursing care as much as possible, even though the government has moral responsibility to take care of its people.

"It is believed that art plays a vital role as it portrays the significant value of cultures and traditions in the society. I agree with the argument that art ought to be taught at school; however, in my opinion, students should focus on every subject that is taught to them and not just arts.  Studying art could relieve the stress and tension that school children are going through. In other words, take music as an example. It has a higher capability of soothing young minds. In addition to this, many art subjects are beneficial for developing cognitive skills such as creative thinking in children. Nowadays, the majority of schools and childcare centres use art based activities to keep children occupied and help them overcome boredom. On the other hand / however, there is no need for children to give greater importance to art subjects than other subjects like science or maths. Moreover, it would be advantageous for the future careers if children engage in studying technological subjects. This does not mean that music, arts, literature and other artistic subjects should be completely ignored; rather students should focus on them as well. There are plenty of people who became great authors, musicians and actors by following arts. In conclusion, it can be clearly seen that learning art subjects will bring positive outcomes for children.

"In recent years, obesity has become the most common health issue among children. Many people believe that parents of obese kids should be penalized for their role in making their children overweight. This essay disagrees with this statement because it is not possible for parents to constantly monitor what their children are eating; also, in many cases genetics play a crucial role in making children obese. Food consumption of children cannot be monitored by parents all the time. When children are at school, they eat snacks and junk and parents will have no control over their dietary intake during this period. A child could consume a lot of junk food without the knowledge and permission of their mother and father when they are left unsupervised. This routine could eventually lead to addiction towards the high calorie food and can cause a lot of fluctuations in their weight. A recent study found that the majority of students consume an average of 70% of their per day recommended calorie allowance during the school hours alone in the form of unhealthy food.  Genetic issues can also cause weight inconsistencies among children and teenagers. Innate genetic disorders drop the metabolic rate and it becomes burdensome for children to maintain their body mass index. In these circumstances, there is little parents can do to help their children maintain normal weight and they should not be held accountable because it is the child’s genes that are most responsible. A recent research paper found that 30% of the children in North America suffer from morbid obesity due to genetic disorders and are vulnerable to extra body fat.  In conclusion, parents should not be punished if their sons or daughters are overweight because it is impractical to keep a check on their diet throughout the day and genes play a crucial role in determining the weight of a human.

"The internet is a treasure house of information. Today an increasing number of people prefer to find information through web sources rather than books. In my opinion, this is a positive development which benefits the environment and helps save money.  Firstly, discovering information online plays a vital role in protecting the environment. When people depend on websites for news and information, trees do not have to be cut down to produce paper. This helps save the forest cover and reduces the impact of global warming. Thus it is evident that finding information online is beneficial for the environment.  Secondly, most of the information online can be accessed for free or at minimal costs. By contrast, paper based books and magazines are expensive and poor people cannot afford them. To cite an example, a large number of research students complete their thesis by accessing data for their project on websites like Scribd.com where most of the journals can be downloaded for free.  Of course, there are some downsides to using the internet for finding information. To start with, it is not always possible to verify the accuracy of online data. There are also some health risks to excessive usage of digital devices. It can cause eye fatigue, blurred or strained vision. To recapitulate, finding information online is a positive development because it helps save the environment by reducing the use of paper. Also, online information is readily available to all sections of the society.

"Every society considers art and music as the core components of their culture. In my opinion, the importance of art and music has only increased in this age of technology and hence students should be urged to learn them. We are living in increasingly stressful times. Of course, technology has made our lives easier. It has created new industries and jobs that did not exist previously. However, technology has also introduced stress into our lives. Most people now have demanding jobs that drain out their energy. Art and music enable them to relax their mind and stay tuned to the rhythm of life after a hectic day at work.  Another reason art still maintains its relevance is that it unites people. Technology is a double edged sword. It can both connect and divide people. Miscreants use technology to promote their divisive agenda. In this troubled times people need something to unite them and art does that job perfectly. It is a common interest that we all share. For example, Indian music and art have a history of thousands of years and they have played an amazing role in uniting the country and its people over the course of history. Indians everywhere are proud of their musical traditions and brilliant sculptures and carving adorning their temples, palaces and monuments. Without these elements of culture, it is not possible to unite a heterogeneous mix of over a billion people.  As for the reasons to encourage students to learn art and music, despite the fact that we are living in a technology driven world, art is still a coveted career option. Music is known to soothe human minds and is widely integrated with every modern infotainment devices. In addition, now music therapy is used to relieve people of their stress and anxiety without any side-effects. I firmly believe that art and music are crucial disciplines even today and hence parents must encourage their children to learn them in depth. Even a general learning of these subjects is known to increase students’ proficiency in other academic subjects.  In conclusion, art and music have always been appreciated throughout the world and their popularity remains intact even today. Hence, it is recommended that children learn these subjects as they make them smarter and may also lead to a prosperous career. Do you have an essay on this topic?

There are, nonetheless, many others who insist that in order to fully enjoy a movie, it has to be watched on the big screens of a cinema. In my opinion, watching a movie on a big screen is certainly more enjoyable but watching it on our devices is more convenient as it saves both time and money and hence I prefer this option.  Thanks to the advancements in technology, even a high definition movie can now be streamed online and watched on a computer or mobile phone from anywhere and at any time. There are several free and paid movie streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Youtube and Amazon Prime and they have a huge collection of movies belonging to various genres. By paying a small monthly fee, people can stream any number of movies from these platforms to their devices and watch them at their convenience.  This is especially suitable for people whose time constraints do not permit them to watch an entire movie in one sitting. They can pause and resume watching as per their convenience.  On the other hand, cinemas provide a better viewing experience because of their large screens, Dolby surround sound systems and the special ambience. For example, action scenes leave a greater impact on the audience when they are watched on the larger than life screens of a movie theatre. Also, the theatre provides a distraction free environment that allows the audience to immerse themselves into the movie.

"A reasonable number of people are paid extremely high in many countries. While some people argue that it is beneficial for the overall development of the nation, others are of the opinion that the government should cap salaries / put a cap on the remuneration. I do not agree with this view. In my view, if salaries are high, the country will progress faster. On the one hand, people believe that enormous salaries immensely benefit the nation and I agree. If people earn more, they can contribute more to the government through their taxes. This tax amount can be used for the welfare of the citizens through schemes such as free education and better infrastructure that can increase the standards of living. Another reason for supporting astronomical pay cheques is that it deters talented people from leaving their country. Let us consider India as an example. Earlier, the average salary of an Indian was sufficient only to take care of his own needs. However, in the last two decades, the situation has improved tremendously after the boom in the IT sector. India is generating significant revenue through taxes which is being spent on medical and engineering researches.  On the other hand, some people insist that government authorities must impose an upper limit on earnings. They believe that high salaries of a few people can cause societal imbalance. In other words, it will result in a massive discrimination in the society because the affluent people tend to exercise control over the lower class. Consequently, the nation becomes a breeding ground for illegal activities and terrorism. This will not only destruct the reputation of the nation but also impede foreign investments and other trades. Hence, people think that if there is an upper limit on an individual’s income, equality will prevail in the community and citizens can live in harmony. In conclusion, despite contrasting views, I believe that for the development of a nation, higher salaries are imperative. This will induce better revenues in addition to deterring the skilled people from leaving their country.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In modern day western society one can easily become obese, as the availability of cheap and unhealthy food is high. Nonetheless, many people desire to be healthy and slim and therefore have chosen to follow special diets or exercise regimes so as to not become obese. Others believe, however, that people should be better informed about today’s unhealthy lifestyles and the poor food they are consuming before such diets and regimes are taken into consideration. Personally, I agree that the unhealthy lifestyle of many people must be addressed before thinking about ways of losing weight through special diets.It has become habitual for people to cook using ingredients that have been pre-cooked or to which chemicals have been added. Additionally, several people consume a lot of microwave and fast food, which are both easy to purchase and prepare, but are often fairly unhealthy. Due to the fact that it has become less popular to cook meals using fresh ingredients, people consume chemicals, taste intensifiers, salt and sugar without realising. By consuming food that has been made by mass production, one no longer has to think largely about how a meal is prepared and can simply consume it without thinking about the ingredients.It seems logical that in order to lose weight effectively and over a long period of time, one has to learn to eat in a healthy way and to carry out sport on a regular basis. Learning how to cook with fresh ingredients is an important aspect of eating in a healthy way, and, by doing so, people can avoid eating food that has been pre-made. If people do not understand this concept, they will fall back into unhealthily habits after their diet is over.In conclusion, today’s unhealthy lifestyles as well as the poor quality food consumed by people on a regular basis must be addressed before thinking about diets or exercise regimes. If people can combine exercise with wholesome eating habits, they will be happier and healthier.",9,False,79.88978360098874,328
"It is often argued that at school kids should learn about cultivating their own vegetables and preparing the meals using them. This essay strongly agrees with this argument. I believe that children from their early age should learn this  important  life skill for survival and this also  teaches them to value their food and not to waste it . Firstly, educating children about producing their own food gives them a broad idea of the steps involved in the agricultural process. Practically teaching them about cultivating and processing the food to make it edible is the best way to inspire the young minds. It is also one of the important life skills that need to be given the same importance as skills like swimming and self defence techniques. This helps them be independent in their future life. Secondly, students who grow vegetables and some varieties of spinaches and cook their meals are less likely to waste the food. Since they spend a lot of energy and time in the cultivation process, they value their food more. For instance, my eight year old niece used to eat lots of junk foods and refuse to eat healthy dish made of vegetables before involving herself in a science project to grow carrots on her own. This science project completely changed her eating habits.  Apart from these facts, home grown veggies are organic and healthy because they use natural fertilizers and almost no pesticides.  To conclude, the art of growing food and cooking it on their own is an important life skill that needs to be taught in school. It is a practical way of learning  different processes involved in agriculture and also teach students to value their food more.",8,False,75.56410256410257,284
"A consistent increase in the popularity of solar energy as a means of providing household energy has been noticed in many countries around the world. Many factors contribute to this gradual increase in the acceptance and acknowledgment of Solar Energy. The need to meet the ever growing requirements of energy supply is the main motivation behind pursuing the development of an alternative energy generation system. Another reason is the non-existence of any harmful by products of the solar power generation system, unlike all other types of energy generation systems. There are several advantages of Solar Energy. Unlike other energy sources like coal and petroleum the source of solar energy the sunlight is non-perishable .The absence of any harmful impact on the environment and the ability to function in perfect harmony with the ecosystem makes it an ideal energy generation system. In addition to this the abundant supply of sunlight and the improved technology to tap into this energy source has immensely helped in the increase of its popularity. However there are few problems associated with solar energy. The limited although improved technology dampens the drive to use it as a power source. Moreover there are various other factors such as the lack of a support system for repairs, replacement of malfunctioning devices in the domestic solar generation systems which are proving to be a major hindrance. Another issue is that the availability of sunlight is subject to many factors and there are many countries worldwide which do not receive any sunlight during certain parts of the year. Replying on such dynamic power source might handicap the users of the system in more than one way.

People have different opinions about whether history is crucial to comprehend the present picture of the world or not. While some content of history is not worth learning, I feel that history really makes / helps people understand the present world. Some areas of history could be considered as pointless to learn. Firstly, history consists of dates and years of the events that occurred in the yester centuries; however, these numbers are neither intriguing nor useful in daily life. And yet, students waste a great deal of time trying to memorize the years and dates.  Nevertheless, learning about the past is helpful in several ways. First and foremost, people can better understand the present situation of the world by researching the related history. In India, for example, employment and education sector has reservation system, in which a certain number of seats in educational institutions are reserved for backward classes. Likewise, a certain percentage of jobs in the public sector are also reserved for these those belonging to the backward category. It is easy to justify this practice when people learn about the hardships people belonging to backward classes had to endure in the past. Also, history teaches us about the evolution of various cultures and dynasties. Learning about them instils national pride in people and make them feel good about their heritage.  In conclusion, even though there are specific portions of history, which are useless to learn, I believe that history is an important subject that helps us make better sense of the world around us.",8,False,67.13308936825887,285
"Managers have got wide experience and vast knowledge. They are familiar with the way the business operates. They are also aware of the strengths and weaknesses of their employees. This knowledge and experience allows them to make decisions that are beneficial to the company, its stakeholders and employees. What’s more, while making important decisions several confidential documents are taken into consideration. Security can be an issue if all employees are involved in the process. On the flip side, there are many reasons for employees to participate in the decision making process. They also want to feel that their contribution is valued. If the management involves them in the decision making process they will feel more confident of their roles. This will encourage them to stay longer with the same organization. Studies have shown that one way of reducing the attrition rate is to involve employees while important decisions are made. Wrong decisions taken by the management can have a negative impact on the employees. If they are part of the decision making process, they will be able to make appropriate suggestions. In addition, employees who work in a transparent environment tend to have a better bond with their manager. To conclude, there are many reasons to involve employees in the decision making process.

"More and more students now do part time jobs while they are still at university. In my opinion, working while studying can be hugely rewarding; however, it does have some drawbacks as well. The biggest advantage of doing a part time job is that it makes a student independent. It boosts their self confidence and promotes growth. Moreover by working, they can fund their studies. For instance, they do not have to depend on parents for pocket money or to fulfill any extra need. Apart from this, working part time makes them understand the importance and value of money. For example, when they toil hard and save money for purchasing an item, they learn to value money and use it wisely. Better still, they will learn to respect all labour. However, working while studying has some disadvantages as well. The biggest disadvantage is that it will distract students from their studies. Some students may even drop out of college. Unfortunately, this affects their career prospects because it is not possible for someone who does not have a degree to get a high paying job. By the time they realize this it will be too late. At least some of these disappointed students may indulge in illegal activities to make money quickly. To sum up, I admit that there are several benefits to working while studying.

"Need help with organizing ideas for this essay. Please watch my Youtube video on this. Some people believe that a dedicated mentor is a prominent factor in the academic excellence of the students, while others feel that it totally depends on the outlook of the mentees. This essay will discuss both the above-mentioned views. It will also prove why the student’s attitude is the deciding factor in his/her academic success. Firstly, success is the result of one’s own will power. It is rightly being said that “Where there is will, there is a way.” So, a deeply motivated student will definitely find the way for excelling in studies. Secondly, teachers are not the only available option. There are many books and online videos which can provide guidance and support needed to get the desired success. Moreover, the surroundings of a student also play an important part. Parents, relatives and friends are the influencers who can support and motivate learners to excel in education. For instance, the top rank holders of India’s toughest competition UPSC often hail from very ordinary backgrounds wherein they are unlikely to have received high quality formal education.  However, some people do believe that a good mentor is needed for educational success. It is because they think that a good guide provides proper guidance such as the right learning materials, periodic assessments and tips for scoring well in tests. Moreover, in today’s competitive and advanced world, a qualified and skilled teacher is needed to guide students in the correct way. For example, there are many coaching institutes, which have qualified professors to teach young aspirants to crack the competitive exams and most of them succeed too.

"These days, more and more employees are devoting more time to their work than their family. This trend has some benefits; however, it has a lot of demerits as well. In this essay, I shall explore the pros and cons of working overtime. On the one hand, working long hours accelerates a person’s professional growth. As a matter of fact, people who are willing to work beyond standard work hours are more likely to be promoted. They are also less likely to be laid off in the event of a downsizing. In this day and age when competition is tough working overtime is the only option for many employees to stay in their job. When employees are willing to put in more hours, the organization will be able to deliver projects on time and this in turn will improve their bottom line. Companies may also share a part of the profit with their employees by offering them higher salaries.On the other hand, when people spend too much time at the workplace their family relationships suffer the most. Having little or no time for one’s spouse and children will lead to conflicts within the family. This will increase the stress levels of employees as we all their family members. Stressed out workers cannot deliver satisfactory performance at the workplace even if they spend too much time in the office. Another downside of this trend is that working long hours without taking a break will affect the health of workers. They become more prone to developing various lifestyle diseases like hyper tension, diabetes and cardiac trouble. This in turn will further reduce their productivity by forcing them to avail of more sick leaves. To conclude, unrealistic targets and tough competition hves forced many employees to work overtime. The main advantage of this situation is that it might improve their chances of getting a promotion or raise. The main disadvantage is that it affects their health and productivity by elevating their stress levels. In my opinion, it is important for employees to strike a work-life balance.",9,False,68.6,343
"There is no doubt that modern technology is reshaping our planet and affecting every aspect of human lives. From a social perspective, many people argue that the gap between the upper class and lower classes is widening as a result of technological advancements. Others, however, believe the opposite.There are several reasons why one could think that the wealth inequality is, indeed, increasing. The most common reason is  automation. Driven by technology, automation reduces the need for manual labour. As a result, less work opportunities are available for unskilled people. With each iteration of the cycle the competition increases and wages decrease. , technology has increased the minimum level of needs that should be satisfied. Nowadays, everybody should have a mobile phone and an internet connection, including the poor. This increases the monetary burden on them as they must borrow to cover these new needs.However, I firmly believe that the aforementioned opinion is ludicrous. The most obvious reason is that modern technology has facilitated the road to riches in an unprecedented manner. For instance, many of the internet billionaires are from lower and middle classes. Moreover, the major leaps in agricultural technologies  magnified food production. As a result, food has become more affordable and available. Finally, leveraging technology has dramatically increased workers’ productivity. Consequently, compensations and salaries have increased.In conclusion, I strongly believe that technology could possibly narrow the difference between social classes. Increased food production, opportunities and productivity are just few examples of technology’s contribution to bridging the wealth gap.",8,False,92.38167005676945,249
"It is seen that museums and historical places are visited by tourists and local people avoid visiting them. This essay will discuss the reasons for this and suggest a viable solution to encourage native people to visit museums and monuments. To embark on, there are some reasons why local citizens do not visit museums. First and foremost, people find it boring to visit such places. It takes a considerable amount of time to explore these heritage sites and people hardly find anything new. Museums house artefacts and artworks which might not be everyone’s cup of tea. So people feel that it is a waste of time to visit monuments and art galleries. Secondly, many of the museums and historical sites charge an entry fee. If a person visited it once, they would avoid visiting it again because nobody wants to pay again and again to watch the same artworks. For instance, there is a museum in my city named “The Chocolate Room”. It charges a hefty 1000 rupees as entry fee and last month my cousin requested me to visit the museum but I refused due to the fact that I had already visited the museum and I did not want to pay the entry fee again. There are some possible solutions which can attract local people to visit museums and historical buildings. These places depict the history and the culture of our forefathers. So schools can impart knowledge about historical places amongst the students so that they gain interest in and respect for such places. Additionally, traditional museums can be blended with modern museums to give a new experience to the visitors. For example, Madame Tussauds museum houses ancient paintings along with modern wax made statues of well-recognized celebrities. After this fusion, there is a massive rise in the number of local and foreign visitors to the museum. Lastly, scraping the entry fee can also attract native people to revisit the museums and historical buildings. To recapitulate, it is clear that local people avoid visiting museums and historical building because they are out-dated and charge an entry fee. To rekindle locals’ interest, schools can teach students about the importance of such places; authorities must strive to update museums frequently and entry fee can be exempted. This is another essay on this topic. Museums and historical places are considered as the knowledge centers of a city. They depict the history, the culture and the tradition of that area. It can be seen that the local people do not prefer to go to these sites; only the tourists visit them. This essay will discuss why locals do not visit museums and historical buildings and also suggest some ways to attract them. To begin with, there are several reasons why local members do not visit the local places of history and museums. First and foremost individuals are busy with their domestic chores and they are happy with their sedentary lifestyles. For example, it should be noted that Delhi boasts of a number of museums and historical monuments; the local people do not visit them because the majority of the population in Delhi is working. They have long working hours and after coming back from work they are left with very less energy. Tourists, on the other hand, are in a city to explore all places of interest, so they will definitely visit museums. There are myriad ways to attract native people to museums and historical sites. For example, schools can give their students assignments related to the history, culture and tradition of their native place. This will encourage most parents to take their children to museums to collect useful information. In addition, local administration can conduct various exhibitions at these places to attract local people. For example, the exhibitions on local handmade products can attract locals. To conclude, local people do not visit local museums and historical sites due to the fact that they are busy with their life. We can use various ways to get them interested. For example, conducting exhibitions and giving arts and history based assignments in schools will help.",8,False,65.51964085297419,680
"In England and Australia, the jury is not given the previous crime history of the accused. Some lawyers believe that having access to all the previous records of the defendant helps the judges to pronounce accurate verdicts. I completely agree with the statement and shall put forth my arguments in the upcoming paragraphs. It is pivotal for the bench to have past records of the criminal so that they do not make any prejudiced decisions. Previous history of the accused helps in deciding the severity of the punishment. For example, repeat offenders such as serial murderers and rapists should receive stringent punishment whereas someone who commits a crime under the influence of unfavourable circumstances should be treated more leniently.  Moreover, innocent people are also benefited, if the past records are taken into consideration as they will not be misjudged. For example, a girl may commit murder in order to protect herself from being raped. In other words, breaking the law for self-defense or such circumstances should not be compared with committing a crime intentionally. In this case, the clean history of the girl can save her from life imprisonment or from death sentence. Moreover, the previous history gives insight into the criminal’s social background, upbringing, education, character and mental health status. Therefore, the jury can read the subconscious mind of the convicted and take a well-defined, appropriate, conscious decision.  In conclusion, it is evident from the above arguments that the jury must be made aware of the comprehensive past records of the accused to make judgements without flaws.

"A majority of people choose to give software companies access to their personal information so that they can use a software application for free. People can use the software for myriads of fruitful purposes; however, in my opinion, because of the fact that corporations can misuse the private data for their own benefits, the advantages of this practice do not outweigh the disadvantages.  By giving access to information such as email address to a technology company, people can have full right to make use of the application for their indispensable needs. This can make their life more convenient and less laborious. For example, you must allow your camera and photos to be accessed to use Skype, a video calling software. By using this software people can have the benefit of staying connected to their loved ones irrespective of / regardless of their location and distance. However, sometimes people might experience the breach of their confidential information by some agencies. Providing companies access to our personal data can sometimes lead to the infringement of our privacy and security. Some applications take advantage of the process of accessing information just to gather and exploit it for malicious purposes. For instance, in 2014, Unibic calling application was highly criticized for selling the confidential data of various people to an advertising company in return for a huge amount of money. Therefore, the threat of potential misuse of personal information eclipses the advantages of having free access to an application.  In conclusion, while it is true that people can use the software for numerous important purposes in exchange for their personal information, establishments can misuse the provided data. So, I believe that benefits do not outweigh the drawbacks. If you have an essay on this topic, post it below in the comments for a free band score estimate. ",8,False,67.59634769195667,301
"Whether companies should solicit private information from candidates during the recruitment process or not is a contentious issue. Despite the fact that there are obvious advantages to not collecting those data, I believe that the benefits far outweigh its disadvantages. In this essay, I will provide my opinions. On the bright side, collecting more background information from potential employees allows employers to select the right candidates for the job / candidates who fit the job profile perfectly. Companies can gauge the suitability of their prospective employees through data such as their specific hobbies and interests. For instance, if there is a job position which requires meeting new colleagues and travelling abroad frequently, an applicant who is interested in socializing and traveling would be deemed a better fit for the vacancy than those who are fond of reading and listening to music. Furthermore, certain information enables employers to provide a safe working environment for all workers. To illustrate, collecting information such as previous criminal record is essential for the human resource manager to determine whether the potential employee will pose a threat to the company or not. On the flip side, some applicants may show hesitation if they are required to fill in more information beyond educational background and working experience. Consequently, companies may lose some workers with great potentials. Furthermore, fake information can be provided to the employers because some candidates may want to impress their potential interviewees. The unreliable data is therefore useless to the employment selection process.  To conclude, although there are downsides to asking for further information from those who are looking for jobs, I support the claim that employers should obtain more personal data from the job seekers because this is important to the safety of the company and enable) them to choose the best employee from among hundreds of applicants.

"There is a general belief that robots will become an integral part of our lives in the real future. They can be deployed in a variety of environments. In my opinion, they will be largely beneficial to humanity.  Today, technology advancement is a fast and rapid phenomenon. Automation can be found already in many areas such as banking and security. With the new upcoming developments, its functional areas will widen up. Robots can be used in low skill jobs such as house-keeping, mechanics and also in areas / jobs which risk human life like, army, space exploration and rescue operations. These kinds of tasks do not require human much intervention and can be done by computer programming. For instance, it is predicted that by 2030, the world’s major superpower will be replacing humans by robots in the army. So, with the ongoing growth in artificial intelligence, there will be many new avenues for the deployment of robots. The increase in the growth of robot usage has a positive impact. This will not only reduce the human errors but it will also save lives involved in life threatening jobs. Firstly, machines are commanded and monitored by computer programming which considerably reduces the chances of making mistakes. For instance, breaching a coded system is tougher than breaking a human protected system. Secondly, fields such as space exploration and rescue operations put human life in a risky situation and this can be avoided / reduced with the involvement of robots. For example, in a fire breakout robots can handle the evacuation process, saving human lives. Hence, work done by robots in many areas is a good move. In conclusion, this essay outlined the different areas in which robots can successfully operate and it also regarded this trend as a favourable development. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to some people, salary is the first thing to consider when choosing a job. I agree with this statement to a great extent but in my opinion other factors like job satisfaction cannot be ignored.  Salary should definitely be the first consideration. No other factor has a greater impact on a person’s life or lifestyle than their income. The cost of living keeps increasing year after year and people are living under considerable financial stress these days. Everything from education and healthcare to food and housing has become expensive. If the salary is not adequate enough to meet the expenses, all aspects of a person’s life will be severely affected. In addition, if people are paid well, they will feel that the company appreciates their contribution. A good salary even elevates a person’s self image and social image. Obviously, it is not hard to see why most people give so much importance to the pay packet.  Having said that, salary cannot be the only consideration when choosing a job. Job satisfaction is equally important. The job should pay well; it should provide satisfaction as well. In addition, the work hours should be reasonable. Employees are also human beings and they seek work-life balance just like everyone else. A job may pay an astronomical remuneration, but if the working conditions are pathetic, it is foolish to take it. In my opinion, choosing a job that pays a little less but offers satisfactory working conditions is a much better idea.  To conclude, the remuneration should definitely be the first thing to consider when choosing a job because it is impossible to lead a comfortable life without a decent salary. However, money alone cannot make people happy and hence other factors like job satisfaction and working hours too should be considered before taking up a job. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Discuss both views and give your opinion. It is often argued that kids of employed couples get most appropriate support from play schools or day care centres, whilst others disagree and think grandparents are the best caretakers to support young ones. This essay agrees with the argument that the best option to guard the kids who miss their parents due to employment. This essay will discuss both the perspectives. On the one hand, parents take care of their grandchildren solely due to the factor of love and affection. Also, more than just caretakers, they help the babies to learn and enjoy their time in a comfortable and merry way. Moreover, the blood relationship help better bonding and create an overall healthy atmosphere , which in turn foster better growth and character formation. For Instance, a recent research found that babies learn 37 percentage faster from parent or Grandparents. For this reason, my view is that grandparents are better caretakers than institutions who run baby care centres for monetary benefits. On the other hand, playschools offer services on monetary basis and point of view of such institutions are not the wellbeing of the babies. As money is the motivating factor, day care centres usually accommodate 20 to 25 kids at a time and that makes it difficult to concentrate on all in an attentive fashion. Furthermore, for babies pre-school age is crucial for learning and grasping things from elders, which the care centres may ignore or fail to address. For example, a recent satisfaction survey on pre-schools in UK shows that 56 percentage of parents are dissatisfied with the learning and support provided by such centres. To conclude, it is highly necessary to understand and acknowledge the needs of young ones in more passionate way like a grandparent does than substituting them or relying on professional institutions to fulfill it.",8,False,97.18032786885246,304

While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s  and learning.First of all, a workplace designed for adults  normally  child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable  children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms.

A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that  required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.To conclude, a child’s paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children’s learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.",8,False,87.11111111111111,252

"Dedication is a ubiquitous trait that is instilled in most of us. However, I have always wondered why some people earn more than others. Despite the fact that everyone seems to work hard, there seems to be stark income equality in any society. Thus, we ought to explore this matter. In a free market economy, wages are proportionate to the value of a particular employee, worker or a hired person. Such value is determined by that person’s contribution to the establishment he is working for. Thus, Celebrities gain so much money because of the enormous return they bring to the investor. For example, a typical American movie is likely to achieve three hundred percent profitability. I am never shocked when I hear about movies that can bring profits amounting to two hundred millions dollars. However, many criticize the ways in which a free market economy functions. As far as they are concerned, they believe that even though some jobs may not generate an astounding income for an organization, these jobs are regarded as indispensable to a functioning society. For example, garbage men, as humble as this job may sound like, are essential for any city’s sanitation. Without them, inhabitants of a city would be engulfed by a horrendous plague of diseases.

"To commence with, one of the main causes of obesity among people is the poor eating habits. Firstly, this is due to the availability of junk and unhealthy food from fast-food restaurants which are in every corner of the street. Secondly, most of the individuals in the present-day society hold white collar jobs. Due to the insufficient time and stressful lives, people are replacing daily diet meals with instant processed food. To exemplify, the packaged foods are purchased and kept in the fridge for days. This is not fresh and nutritious, and hence this affects their health, leading to the build up of fat and health problems. On the other hand, there are solutions to overcome the problems arising due to obesity. One possible solution would be to consume healthy and nutritious home cooked food rich in vitamins and nutrients essential for the normal functioning of the body. This could also help us survive longer. For example, according to some research the Japanese are expected to live longer than other race due to their healthy eating habits. Another solution that would contribute to fat loss and fitness is weight and strength training. Also, this contributes to a healthy society. To conclude, there are several health problems that are associated with obesity but the solutions are available too. Incorporating healthy eating habits along with consistent training seem to be an effective solution to control and reduce this problem from deteriorating further.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"People often debate what subjects should be taught at school. Some people argue that subjects like art, music and drama should be made as compulsory as other academic subjects from the elementary level. I totally agree with the view as learning these practical subjects improves the intellectual skills of students and hones their skills for a bright future. To begin with, these three subjects help to develop children’s imagination and interest in learning. The Children at an early age enjoy learning through enjoyable and creative methods as they help to bind the concentration in different ways. For instance, in kinder school, pupils learn alphabets more rapidly by using the rhyming technique than the traditional method. Thus, it is evident that non-academic subjects play a crucial role in developing the intellectual skills of students.  In addition, not everybody is capable of becoming a successful doctor, engineer, businessman or lawyer. Different students have different learning abilities. Some students lack interest in academics but have great hold on extra-curricular subjects. Therefore, at an early age, getting hands on experience in these subjects assists learners to develop expertise which might prove to be beneficial in future. Studies have also shown that  In conclusion, I firmly believe that subjects like music, art and drama should be made compulsory in schools from the elementary level itself. These subjects will not only improve the intellectual skills of the students, but also give them an opportunity to polish their latent talents. And students who have a flair for art or drama might even be able to build a career in those fields.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In the present world, the advancement of technology such as the internet and online communication has reduced the gap between different continents considerably. Hence, I strongly agree with the view that the internet has made the world smaller / brought people closer. I believe that the progress in the internet technology has made international communication much easier than ever before. To begin with, the method of talking with people is becoming much more efficient and quicker due to the internet nowadays. For instance, the geographical barrier between continents has reduced to a great extent because of the internet. A person from the USA can easily chat with his loved ones in India due to the invention of technology. What’s more, they can do this anytime and from anywhere with a few taps on their phone or computer.  In addition, there are many great social media platforms such as Facebook or WhatsApp messenger through which one is able to make not only voice call but also real-time face video chat. In other words, people do not feel apart from each other even if they are living abroad. This is not possible without the internet technology. Furthermore, the development of business has become quite/more flexible and convenient not only for vendors but also for traders. This is possible because the internet has provided a much faster route to communicate between customers and vendors. For example, the trader can simply talk with his vendors for his business by using the electronic mail or Skype. Better still, they do not have to travel or meet in person to close a business deal. Thus, the internet saves) time and money for both of them as they do not need to spend on travel or accommodation expenses which they might have to incur if they had met face to face.  In conclusion, the internet has greatly reduced the communication barrier between the people on the earth. This, in turn, has facilitated effective and efficient chat between not only relatives who live thousands of miles apart but also businessmen. In fact, this flexibility will be helpful for a nation to expand trade globally and thus boost the economy.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"While some people believe that boarding schools are an outstanding option for children, others disagree with this view. This essay will look into both sides of the argument and reach a logical conclusion. On the one hand, those who argue that boarding schools are a better option for children claim that children can easily learn discipline at the boarding, and it is the best place to gain academic qualifications. It is well-known that many boarding schools have a set of strict morning and night routines which children must obey and follow. For instance, they have to exercise for an hour in the morning. No electronic devices are permitted on the campus and no lights are allowed after a certain hour in the night. These strict routines and rules teach children discipline. For these reasons some people advise that boarding schools are the best places for children to study. Conversely, those who argue against sending children to boarding claim that parents will lose control over their children. Children spend most of their time in boarding schools; therefore, parents will have no way of knowing what is happening in their children’s daily life. For example, parents have no way to find whether their children are being bullied at school. This level of distance between children and their parents is an unhealthy way of raising a child. In conclusion, it seems boarding schools can be a better option for children to learn discipline. However, it is not an excellent option because it affects the relation between parents and children, and it does not give a chance to parents to monitor their children on daily basis.",8,False,60.76344805371788,272
"Some people argue that it is essential for children to learn moral values from an early age and punishment is the best way to teach this. This essay totally agrees with that statement because parents’ and teachers’ roles are to guide children into the right path. However, parents should not beat their children and instead, they can use other sorts of punishment. It is essential to use punishment as one of the learning methods to show children the right path. This is because youngsters will become spoilt if they can do whatever they want and still receive no punishment when they make mistakes. Therefore, parents and teachers should use this way to teach their children valuable lessons and morality. For example, recent research by Oxford University revealed that adults who were punished during their childhood in the correct way are more reliable and ethical compared to their peers because people’s character is built mainly during childhood. Physical punishment should no longer be used in the modern world. This means that parents and teachers should always be careful about their way of punishment because certain punishment that does not involve beating the children is useful. For example, parents can take away a favorite toy from a child or prevent them from watching TV. There are also some other constructive ways of punishments. For example, nursery schools in Japan ask children to plant trees when they do something wrong.  Such punishments are beneficial for the children and the society. After all, the main purpose of the punishment is to teach the child a lesson and not to hurt him physically.  In conclusion, it is vital for young people to learn how to distinguish between good and bad things and avoid doing mistakes and the most effective way to achieve this is to punish them; however, this punishment should not be physical; rather it should be psychological and practical.

"According to some people, organizations should encourage their senior employees to retire early so that young people can have more job opportunities. In my opinion, this strategy might benefit young job aspirants; however, it will be detrimental for the company.  Senior employees have invaluable experience and for this reason companies should encourage them to stay. Of course, if seasoned workers retire earlier, more young people will get employment. However, this does not always benefit the company. The higher level employees have superior skills and experience that new workers lack. As some of them have worked in the same company for more than two or three decades, they are familiar with the day-to-day operations of the company and their expertise makes them a valuable asset. Consequently, their retirement will result in the loss of a great pool of talented workers and the company will suffer huge losses. There are people who argue that recruiting more youngsters can help companies save money as the salary of experienced workers is exceptionally high. For example, the salary of an employee working at a managerial level may be thrice as much as that of an entry level employee. While this may be true, the retirement of experienced employees will lead to a talent crunch that eventually affects the bottom line of the company. What’s more, if high level workers retire, there will not be enough experienced workers to provide training to the newly hired employees. Without the intensive guidance and supervision of their mentors, new employees will not be able to hone their skills. Gradually, the company will lose productivity and revenue. To conclude, while some people may suggest that senior workers should retire at an earlier age to give more opportunities to the younger ones, I do not agree with this argument as their retirement means a tremendous loss to the companies.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some people say that economic growth can eradicate poverty. Others opine that economic development causes environmental damage and hence it should be discouraged. In my opinion, environmental protection is of paramount importance and hence economic growth should be restricted.  A good reason to stop economic growth is to protect the environment from getting polluted by its harmful by-products. In other words, economic growth needs the establishment of many factories which emit obnoxious gases into the atmosphere and discharge other pollutants into the soil and water. If untreated, these by-products cause huge environmental complications. For instance, the demand for electricity rises due to high economic growth; the majority of power plants in the world use fossil fuels to produce electricity and thus cause considerable damage to the environment.  Another critical reason to protect the environment and discourage economic growth is the lack of any substantial evidence to prove that economic growth eradicates poverty. To put it in another way, billions of people are still living under poverty even after many decades of economic development, casting doubt on the role of economic growth in removing poverty. For example, years of economic growth has made rich people richer and poor people are still struggling for the basic necessities of life. Moreover, with the advancement of technologies less manual work is required in factories and hence fewer job opportunities are available although economy is developing. Obviously, economic growth chiefly benefits the affluent and does hardly anything for the poorest sections of the society.  In conclusion, sacrificing the environment for the sake of economic development is not a wise step, especially, when it is doubtful whether economic development can eradicate poverty.

"Some people think that more refugees should be allowed to settle in developed countries and be provided the basic needs. This essay completely agrees with that statement because every human being has the right to live and neglecting that need will cause more problems. Refugees have no protection to their life and hence affluent nations should come forward to help them. According to the UN Universal Declaration of Human Right, everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms, no matter where they come from. For example, many South Koreans immigrated to other countries due to the Korean War in the 1950-60s and they also received aid from the international community. As a result, South Korea overcame the situation quickly, and now they are able to assist other poor countries. Another reason is the fact that neglecting the refugee problem will cause more negative issues. If displaced people cannot be safe anywhere, they will try to escape from the worst situation to a better place. Eventually, the number of illegal immigrants will increase, and this will likely increase the crime rate. BBC News has reported that ever since Italy implemented its close door policy against refugees, there is a considerable increase in the number of deaths in the Mediterranean Sea. In addition to that, this has provoked antagonism between the refugees and wealthy nations and consequently refugees are getting involved in more criminal activities. In conclusion, economically developed countries should involve in assisting refugees in terms of food supplies and other basic needs and help them to settle down in other nations. After all, helping those in need is our duty as humans and if we neglect it the whole world will pay dearly. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In many nations across the world, boys and girls are sent to separate schools. This essay will discuss the advantages of this trend and then outline its drawbacks. To start with, the main advantage of doing this is that there are minimal chances of sexual abuse. It makes one feel safe and secure when one is among children of one’s own gender. Another merit is that they do not have to deal with any kind of distraction which takes away their focus from their studies, unlike in mixed schools, where boys and girls get attracted to each other and lose focus on their studies. Also, it has been found that the success rate of single gender schools is higher than that of co-educational schools. However, there are some demerits to sending children to the same gender schools. Firstly, it becomes very difficult for a child to interact with a person of opposite gender. Not only do they find it difficult to talk, but they also get a little conscious and confused about their behaviour at that moment. Secondly, this gives rise to gender discrimination. From a very young age, boys and girls get knowledge of the different kind of treatment they receive on the basis of their gender and this gives rise to much bigger issues in the society.  To conclude, although there are advantages to educating children in separate institutes based on their gender, it should not be forgotten that this arrangement does have some adverse ramifications. This may help with their academic grades, but it could hurt their social skills.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Unlike in the past, information is now being increasingly stored on the internet. In my opinion, there are more benefits than disadvantages to this practice. Despite the disadvantages mentioned below, I believe that the knowledge stored on the internet can offer extensive benefits for everyone in the present. Firstly, this source of knowledge is easily accessible from any location. In other words, anyone with access to the internet  can quickly access the knowledge without any geographical constraints. Secondly, knowledge stored online is highly secure. In this digital world, we have many security standards to keep our information safe online. Furthermore, online information can be shared fast. Anyone can share the link of a piece of information over internet to someone else within seconds. Admittedly, there are some minor problems to storing knowledge on the internet. One minor issue is the cost of buying digital devices to access the internet. Some digital devices could be an expensive option for some, whereas books can be a cheaper option to get the same knowledge. Another possible issue is the strain on eyes. For instance, if someone is working on the internet for longer duration, it might lead to some strain on eyes and can cause some stress as well. Although this is not a very common issue, books can still be a safer option. In conclusion, benefits such as easy access to knowledge and security standards far outweigh the minor drawbacks that could result from storing knowledge on the internet.",7,False,58.19297235023042,247
"Sample EssayAlthough it is thought by some that urging young people to abandon their family home at an early age is beneficial for them, others believe that it is better if children stay with their families for longer. In my opinion,  leaving family home early has many advantages for children.On the one  people think that youngsters ought to leave their parents’ house so as to learn life skills at an early age. Their reasoning is that it should push young people towards independence and make them learn from life lessons rather than merely rely on their parents. For example, students who  pursue tertiary study away from their home city might learn taking personal responsibility. Also, living independently will teach children a lot by presenting some difficulties, which, consequently, will add some more experience that may prove essential in their future lives.On the other hand, it is argued that children should stay with their parents for longer for several reasons. Firstly, young people need advice from adults, and no one would be better suited to that than their parents. Secondly, life can be generally harsh, for children in particular. In other words, they might  or take unnecessary risks if they mix with the wrong crowd. It is commonly known that young people tend to be  by unethical people. To avoid that, being under parental supervision is utterly important for children.To sum up, while people’s opinions may vary, I believe that young people should leave their family home at an early age, while parents ought to provide them with appropriate advice and keep an eye on their well-being.",8,False,107.56862580829332,266
"In some countries, obesity is becoming an epidemic. This also affects the fitness level of people. In my opinion, the main causes of obesity are the sedentary lifestyle of people and their unhealthy dietary habits. I believe the only method of combating this epidemic is to modify the life styles and food habits of those concerned.  Most cases of obesity and associated health problems are reported from developed countries. Actually, affluent people are more likely to be obese than their poor counterparts. Studies have shown that the most common causes of obesity are a sedentary lifestyle and excessive consumption of fast food and fizzy drinks. Various studies have also shown that individuals who exercise for at least 30 minutes per day and who follow a healthy diet have minimal chance of getting obese.  Another important reason for this fast growing problem is the lack of health awareness among the population. Most people including housewives and children neglect their health and that is a cause for concern. Schools in the UK now give a report of the weight of their students in the quarterly report to their parents. This shows the extent to which this epidemic has spread. In the past, the way of life itself assured good health. In a world without elevators, home appliances and luxury private transport, we were guaranteed of our daily dose of exercise. The best way to curtail the spread of this menace is to attack it at the source. A good example is seen in Japan and Singapore where office workers and students are encouraged to get fit and exercise for 15 minutes. In countries like the UK, fast food and fizzy drinks are banned in and around schools and residential areas. More importantly, in Singapore, fitness is a measure of assessment at work and school. In conclusion, the current lifestyle and eating habits are responsible for the rise in cases of obesity. Getting physically active and eating a healthy diet are the only way to combat this issue.

"It is common knowledge that being over-weight is detrimental to our physical and mental well-being. This essay will discuss the reasons that have caused this problem and propose some reasonable solutions. Generally speaking, it is inevitable that we have to become fatter as we are leading a life with a much higher quality. Back in the olden days, due to bad economic situation and limited range of goods, we were not able to have so many food choices as we do today. Meat and expensive snacks were luxury commodities to us back then. However, things are quite different today. Thanks to economic progress and agriculture development, we are now able to enjoy a wide range of food at minimal cost. As a result of this, people tend to over-buy food and consequently eat more than their body really needs. Creating awareness about the importance of having a healthy diet is the only way to solve this problem. Reading more books and watching more videos on healthy food habits will be very helpful. Another cause of obesity is the stress of modern life. Studies have shown that people who live highly stressful lives are more likely to be obese. To solve this problem, we have to strike a balance between work and life. For example, during our free time, we should engage in some sort of physical activity. A short walk after meals is a great way to burn some calories. To conclude, we have to lead a healthy life and gain knowledge about health and diet to avoid being obese. Apart from this, our government should control the sale of foods which are rich in fat. In addition, it should build more sports facilities to encourage people to lead physically active lives.

"It is often said that admitting children in boarding schools is an excellent option; however, some people are against this opinion due to various reasons. This essay will discuss the opposing views and give a conclusive opinion. On the one hand, people consider boarding school as the best option because of the benefits it brings to students. Firstly, since students live in an academic environment, there is no chance of distraction and they realise their full potential. Secondly, students learn the importance of being responsible and disciplined and gain independent living skills. For example, students do their chores, manage their time and budget and make their own decisions and choices. In addition to this, students can contact the teachers any time to clarify their doubts and there is and there is a greater opportunity to socialize with students of all kinds.  By contrast, opponents of this view point out that living in an educational environment does not give emotional satisfaction to a child. Parental guidance is indispensable for children until they reach a certain age since only parents can teach certain values to children. Children like to spend their childhood with family members and if admitted in a boarding school, they might feel isolated and develop homesickness and depression. Finally, spending full time in schools causes academic pressure which affects the health of children.  In conclusion, it seems that boarding school education is a better option for students to become knowledgeable individuals; however, being in boarding could be an emotionally draining experience for children and hence parents should consult their children before choosing to send their children to boarding.

"It is often debated whether people should plan for the future or simply live in the moment. In my opinion, both ways of living have their merits.  Living in the present is a great way to beat stress. The past is gone and we can no longer change it. The future is uncertain and there is no way we can predict it. The present is what we have. By making the best use of the present we can enjoy each and every moment of life. This advice is particularly helpful for people who are suffering from terminal illness. Thinking about the uncertain future could be too agonizing and devastating for them. Hence, therapists often suggest that they should experience and focus on the present to reduce their pain. For instance, mindfulness is a form of therapy which guides patients to concentrate on the here and now. Being thankful to the family and friends and feeling blessed for the days that they have lived help the patients forget about the fears of death. People running the rat race also benefit from living in the now. It gives them a moment to take stock of what they have achieved so far.  On the other hand, a little bit of planning is essential to secure our future. While tomorrow is uncertain, the truth is that the vast majority of us will live to seventy or eighty. Without some amount of planning, it is impossible to live a stress free life. For example, every one of us needs to save some money for our retirement. Likewise, planning is essential to have a clear goal in life. Without planning we are like a kite with a broken string. Planning is particularly helpful for young people. It enables them to set up goals and pursue them. What’s more, if we have already planned what we want to do with our lives, we will be able to make better use of our time and resources.   To conclude, there are certainly some merits to living in the present; this, however, does not mean that planning is totally unnecessary. In my opinion, excessive planning should be avoided especially when it hampers our ability to enjoy the present. Even so, it is important for us to have a clear vision in life and it is impossible to achieve it without planning.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Drug abuse is a major concern around the globe with numerous lives at stake; yet, illegal drug trafficking still flourishes. While some people believe that legalizing drugs would be a possible solution for this problem, I firmly disagree with this idea. In this essay, I will elaborate on my view with suitable illustrations. To begin with, many nations have banned drugs because of the potential adverse effects caused by them. For instance, marijuana and cocaine are highly addictive and their consumption leads to hallucinations and severe mental illnesses. These substances are considered dangerous despite their use in treating some life threatening diseases. Hence, if these drugs are made available from pharmacy nearby then it would pave way for their abuse. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, drug abuse is a serious problem around the world. Young people, in particular, are the worst affected / worst victims. Countless teenagers are spoiling their lives by falling to this trap despite the immense regulations imposed on illegal drug trading. As younger generations are the building blocks for a nation, it is a vital concern. Hence, instead of proscribing these deadly drugs, if they are made locally available, then imagine the future of our children and community. To conclude / to recapitulate, it is evident that legalizing all the drugs would negatively affect our community by encouraging drug abuse because of its easy availability, and thus affect the whole nation. I strongly believe that rather than marketing locally, the government should allow the usage of these drugs only for medicinal purpose with stringent laws. This way authorities can prevent drug abuse to a great extent.",8,False,116.75773558368493,267
"Whether or not companies should solicit private information from candidates during the recruitment process is a contentious issue. Despite the fact that there are some valid reasons not to collect personal data, I believe that the benefits of gathering this information far outweigh the disadvantages.  On the bright side, collecting more background information from potential employees allows employers to select the right candidates for the job. Companies can decide whether the candidate is a right fit from their personal data such as hobbies and interests. For instance, if there is a job which requires meeting new colleagues and travelling abroad frequently, an applicant who is interested in socializing and traveling would be deemed a better fit for the vacancy than another person who is fond of reading and listening to music. Furthermore, certain information enables employers to provide a safe working environment for all workers. To illustrate, collecting information such as previous criminal record is essential for the human resource manager to determine whether the potential employee will pose a threat to the company or not. On the flip side, some applicants may be reluctant to provide information beyond their educational background and work experience. Consequently, companies may lose some workers with great potential. Another downside is that sometimes the information provided by the candidate could be false. For example, someone who has no interest in physical activity may list soccer as their hobby for the sake of impressing the employer. Such information is useless for the company and thwarts the very purpose of collecting it.  To conclude, although there are downsides to collecting personal information from job seekers, I support this practice because it enables organizations to find candidates who fit their work culture.

In many countries, residents still prefer to own their homes; however, in the more developed countries, they prefer to rent rather than own because of affordability factors, property taxes, and maintenance costs. In addition to financial barriers, changing culture is another influencer. A lot of people, these days, are migrating for jobs; therefore, it does not make much sense for them to stay anchored to a particular location by acquiring property there.  There are several advantages to renting. For a small family, renting a property helps them keep their expenses in check by avoiding mortgage interests, property taxes, and expensive maintenance. For example, in the state of Texas, USA, residents pay as much as 10 to 12 thousand dollars in property taxes a year. That is roughly the same amount they need to rent a two-bedroom apartment. In addition to taxes, mortgage interest could be anywhere between 8% and 12% for a family with average credit scores. Even though mortgage interest is tax-deductible in most countries, it is something the family needs to cough up each month. In addition to expenses, flexibility is another significant factor. The job market trends are evolving all the time and the demand is shifting from one city to another. The cost of moving is much less if the residents are renting rather than owning; owning also restricts cash-flow temporarily because selling a property takes time.  On the flip side, there are several disadvantages to renting that people should take into account. In the past, families remained integrated because of their ancestral homes and its emotional value. We are already seeing that families are drifting apart because they do not have the anchor to hold them together through time. In addition, those who live their entire life in rented homes spend a considerable amount of money on rent which could have been saved for their retirement. For many, it is helpful to fully own the housing to manage through the ups and downs of retirement.  Finally, monthly rent is an expense as opposed to mortgage payments that build assets / equity for the owners. Over time, an owned property is another asset that holds financial value.  In conclusion, there are many advantages and disadvantages to renting and owning a property. Those who are in the decision-making process should carefully weigh the pros and cons before making a decision, rather than simply considering the monthly expenses.

" Nowadays, it has become very common for youngsters to leave their home and live on their own or with their friends after graduating from school.  And this is the sign of positive development for both the individual and the society.  After finishing graduation a person becomes capable of making decisions in their life and staying away from home will make them mature by enabling them to understand things and manage stuff on their own. One can become self confident and learn to do household chores as well as cultivate life skills like time management, budget maintenance, savings, and so on. In short, they become responsible citizens who are capable of making a difference to the society.   Parents will also feel relaxed when they see their child understanding his responsibilities and becoming independent. Better still, they can find sometime for themselves. For example, they can pursue a hobby or some other interests. This is not exactly easy when they have grown children staying with them because then they will be spending much of their time taking care of the needs and wants of their children.   It is true that this way of living is also associated with some challenges. In some cases children get involved in wrong activities like drugs or crimes due to bad company of friends or roommates. However, this will not happen if parents teach their children to distinguish between right and wrong and make them strong enough to take responsibility for their actions.

"Some people opine that artificially intelligent robots will gradually replace human workers. In my opinion, this is very unlikely to happen. Simple human tasks can be performed by robots; however, complex jobs requiring cognitive touch will still need to be done by humans. This essay will discuss why only a few jobs will be replaced by robots and the others / the rest will continue to need human effort. Simple human tasks that are repetitive and conditional in nature can easily be automated. This is because companies believe that the accuracy and productivity of high volume monotonous tasks are higher when performed by robots than humans. A survey on automation in back end banking process in India reveal that not only does the process errors drop by 95% but also productivity increases by 80% if robotic automation is implemented. For these reasons, human effort on regular menial tasks can be replaced by robotic automation. Conversely, jobs requiring qualities like emotion and intuition will continue to be done by humans. This is because fields like psychology will always need a doctor’s diagnosis. For instance, in the USA, while all patients undergo computer based mental tests, the patient’s diagnosis can only be confirmed accurate by a psychiatrist post face to face counselling sessions. Hence, many complex tasks that need human judgement cannot be replaced by robots. To conclude, it is quite possible for robots to replace a few human jobs. Artificially intelligent robots can replace simple human tasks and support them in a few complex tasks; however, they can never replace all complex tasks done by them. Ultimately, non monotonous tasks requiring human touch can never be fully replaced.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"It is argued that it is better to have friendship with those who share the same mindset. However, others believe it is fruitful to make friends with those who sometimes disagree / argue with us. Although friends who share our values and interests can better understand us in tough situations, people who criticize us or disagree with us could give proper guidance and show us the real situation. This essay will discuss both sides before arriving at a conclusion. On the one hand, friends who share our thought process tend to understand us better in tough times of life. They can imagine themselves in our situation and provide us moral support. For instance, as per Harvard business Review, people who have identical mindset tend to recover faster from any kind of stress or anxiety when they share their problems with one another. Thus, it is quite evident that like-minded personalities assist each other effectively during harsh times. On the other hand, buddies who sometimes contradict our idea or thought can guide us better and show us the reality of life. This kind of people may not support every one of our ideas because sometimes they suspect that we are not going on the right track. For example, if all the friends of a smoker are smokers, he will never get to hear about the harmful consequences of smoking. On the other hand, if he has at least a few non-smokers among his friends, they will constantly advise him to quit smoking. Obviously, there are benefits to having friends who do not possess the same likes and interests as us.   In conclusion, I personally believe that a person should have both like-minded and unlike-minded friends. While friends who share the same interests as us offer great company, those who differ from us can offer better perspective.   Experts throughout the developing and developed world have debated whether it is better to have a friend who shares the same beliefs and thoughts as us or to have a companion who has a completely different mindset. This essay will discuss both sides after which I will provide my perspective on this controversial topic. Those who hold the view that we should select a friend who shares the same opinion as us have their justifications. The main reason for their argument is that one can have a long lasting and harmonious relationship with someone if both of them have the same mindset. This is because there will be less conflict and fewer arguments.  In addition to this, they enjoy their time being together, make good memories and take quick decision. For instance, my relationship with each of my friends has lasted for more than a decade; this is because we hardly have any disagreement when it comes to what to eat, which movie to watch and which game to play. Those who believe that it is better for their companions to have different beliefs and to disagree with them have their rationale. They are convinced that if they have friends with different views, they will be able to make informed decisions. This is because friends who have different perspectives will encourage us to analyse things from different angles.   In addition to this, we enhance our critical thinking abilities and increase our general knowledge. In contrast, if our friends share the same mindset as us, we will probably not be able to prevent some unfavourable outcomes of some decisions we make. Hence, a friend who disagrees with you in certain factors, in fact informs you regarding negative consequences of a step you are about to take. In conclusion, both sides of the argument have merits. Having analysed both schools of thought, I am of the opinion that the benefits of having a partner who disagrees with us cannot be discounted especially with regard to decision making.

"Although it is believed that showering gifts is necessary to express love and care for family and friends, some believe that there are other significant ways to do so. I think gifting is waste of money and resources and one should opt for other ways to show adoration for important people in their life. On the one hand, some believe that gifts and presents should be given because it instantly makes the other person feel elated and special. Undoubtedly, it will help to strengthen the bond with the receiver if that gift is of great value to them. However, this is not always the case and sometimes the gift we buy for them could be of no use to them. For example, when we buy a gift for our friend’s birthday there is a very high probability that another invitee will also bring the same present. In such situations, our gift may lay gathering dust in their attic. Also, gifts have a monetary value and it is not always possible to buy something that will make the receiver happy. More often than not, our gift will fall short of their expectations.  By contrast, spending time with our near and dear ones and offering them financial or other help when they need it the most is a much better way to show our love and concern for the,. Firstly, offering moral and financial support in situations of dire need is the most favourable thing that one can do for their family and friends. Another significant way is to share worthy belongings, knowledge and experiences with the loved ones especially children. This will eventually enable them to have a better future and in return respect for the person who shared these virtues, making the relationship stronger.

"More and more young people are getting involved in criminal activities. Actually, juvenile crime has become a grave social issue all over the world. Some people opine that putting teen criminals behind the bars is the right way to reform them. Others are more in favour of making them do community service. In my opinion, prison terms are unlikely to reform young people because they are too young for the harsh treatment they would receive there. A better solution is to make them give back to the society by engaging in unpaid social work. Alternative punitive methods like community service are more effective than prison terms if young offenders are strictly supervised. Juveniles have a highly impressionable mind and they easily get influenced by their company. In prison, they will be surrounded by other criminals like them and in such an environment it is very unlikely that they will learn their mistakes. Moreover, they are at an exceptionally high risk of getting treated violently in jails. According to an Australian journal of teenage psychology, more than 50% of young prisoners develop psychological issues during the prison term. Therefore, I insist that sending them to prison is hardly the most effective way to reform them. By contrast, if they are made to do community work, they get an opportunity to give back to the society they have harmed. Often times, while engaging in social work, they will get to interact with less fortunate people and do something to improve their lives. This is a great learning experience that will change their perspectives on life. For example, a survey conducted in China has shown that the reoffending rate of young criminals who engaged in compulsory community services is comparatively lower than that of young culprits who were sent to jail.  In conclusion, juveniles are too young to understand the consequences of their action and putting them behind the bars for the crimes they committed is unlikely to help them. In my opinion, making them do community work is a better alternative because it allows them to give back to the society and improves their chances of realizing their mistakes.",9,False,72.64373251970505,356
"In most education systems around the world, physical education is one of the components of the syllabus. However, this is a controversial topic, as it has been argued that sport as a school subject is unnecessary. Opposing this is the view that physical education is a vital aspect of the education.Physical education was introduced into schools to promote a healthy lifestyle by exposing students to different types of sport and ensuring that those who are not naturally sporty are exposed to exercise and its benefits. For students who are already very active, having a sports lesson might be unnecessary, but those who are not given the opportunities or who are not from active families depend on schools for exercise. Furthermore, a school is supposed to educate on multiple levels, a key aspect of which is healthy living. It is not sufficient to discuss exercise in class; students must experience the effects that ensue. One of these benefits is that exercise enables people to concentrate more efficiently and work more efficiently, meaning that having sport as a subject is beneficial to other subjects as well.On the other hand, exercise to some degree is a personal matter and forcing students to exercise in class can then have the opposite effect. This feeling can lead to students not pursuing any sports later due to negative experiences and memories connected to it. Another argument is that exercise is a leisure activity and therefore not school-related and should be practiced outside of school.In conclusion, while negative results can be caused through physical education, it is vital for students to take part in it. Some students are only exposed to a healthy lifestyle in schools and therefore there is a responsibility to educate individuals in this area.",9,False,49.6291504539559,291
"To begin with, technologies in principle were created to help people solve different tasks faster and better. People face numerous challenges in areas of education, work, health, finance and governance. Many of these tasks are hard and time consuming. And technologies can make such tasks more comfortable. For example, with the help of distance learning we can receive education any time and from anywhere. This allows us to spend time in more efficient ways to learn a few more skills, for instance. Furthermore, technologies improve the quality and speed of our workflow a lot. That is to say calculations that were done by computer are obviously more accurate than those done by humans, because risk of making errors / mistakes is non-existent. Moreover, those tasks that required 1 hour of our time in the past now can be done in just 5 minutes with the help of the computer.   Another argument in favor of my statement is that technologies help us to become more efficient in our communication with other people. We can keep in touch with people regardless of their location by using the internet. In other words, we can promote our social interaction indefinitely.  To conclude, I think that positive influence of technologies on our life is obvious. Technologies not only help us to be efficient at work and study, but also contribute to productive social interaction. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Nowadays, students are increasingly moving to a foreign country for higher education. In my opinion, advantages of this trend outweigh disadvantages. There are a few disadvantages to moving to another country for higher education. Firstly, the students have to stay away from the comforts of their home. This can create stress and anxiety in them. They will miss the love and warmth they received from their parents. This can affect their performance in their studies. Secondly, moving to a foreign country for education is expensive. Usually students move to a developed country for higher education. Therefore, when they convert their currency to a foreign currency, they don’t have much money at their disposal. However, the benefits of going abroad for higher education are truly remarkable. When students move to a rich country, they can enjoy the new facilities and advanced technologies which are not available in their developing native country. In addition to this, sometimes very few seats are available for certain courses in some developing countries. In this situation, too, relocating to a country where more seats are available for the same course is advantageous for the students. Another benefit is that the students can learn a new culture. They can experience different kinds of exotic dishes, habits and practices. These experiences are often enjoyable and can make the students more tolerant of differences. Going overseas for education also helps the students to settle in a first world country with good job and this can increase their social status in their native country. In conclusion, the upsides of foreign education are always greater than the downsides. However, students should carefully consider their options before going abroad.",8,False,52.9469196919692,277
"The number of households where both partners work are steadily on the rise and that is hardly surprising. Women have already proved that they are capable of performing just as well as men on the professional stage. Some people believe that when both partners have full-time jobs, they should divide the housework evenly between them. I totally agree with this view. There is no denying the fact that when dual income couples share their household responsibilities, it improves the quality of their marital life. All women – both working and non-working – will appreciate it when their partners take the time to share the housework with them because it is a clear sign that their men care for them. When a working woman is forced to do all the housework without any help, it has a very negative effect on her mental and physical well-being. What’s more, it affects her performance on the work front. Working women who do not have the support of their partners are also more likely to quit their job.  When couples share the responsibilities of domestic life, they set a good example for their children. Children raised in such families will learn the value of empathy. And when they become adults they will have no trouble sharing the responsibilities with their respective partners.  After analyzing the situation, it is felt that working couples should be encouraged to share the responsibilities of their day-to-day life. It improves their family life and career prospects. By shouldering the responsibilities of household duties, parents also pass on worthy character traits to their children. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some people think that many renowned personalities are popular because of their riches and extravagant lifestyle, rather than their achievements, and this influences the youth in a negative way. I agree with this view to a certain extent. Young adults are very ambitious and they look up to the famous people for inspiration and setting their own life goals. Popularity is a natural attraction for everyone. But looking up to celebrities, who are known only because of their wealth and posh lifestyle, is not a good thing. Glamour and money are ephemeral. Youngsters should be taught that money and glamour can come and go whereas the rewards that come with hard work and struggle stay for life. Celebrities should be famous for the hardships they faced for their achievements. Their journey to fame along with all the trials and tribulations should be highlighted and put in front of the young. Youngsters should be made aware of the fact that to achieve fame and make a name for themselves, these celebrated people faced a lot of tough times. For example, Steven Hawkins, the world famous physicist, lived almost whole of his life in a wheelchair, but his contribution to science can never be forgotten. Just money and glamour do not make a person famous. Focusing just on the money and the glorious lifestyle surely sets a bad example to the youth and sets their expectations wrong. The young get inspired to be like these popular people and do not pay much attention to how to be like them. They ignore the struggle that is necessary to get to this status. This way they do not realise that the rewards have to be earned. Naturally, many of these youngsters end up not acquiring these riches for themselves, which leads to a feeling of frustration and depression amongst them. To conclude, I am of the view that people should be popular for their struggle and success rather than their money and glorious lifestyle, as it inspires the youth and sets their expectations right. It makes them realize the importance of the hard work, which is required to gain the prize of fame.",8,False,56.82965194109772,359
"Social networking sites are platforms where people from all walks of life can connect and share ideas and even do business. Social networking has become both a boon and a bane to the present generation. These sites are intended to connect people from different locations so that they can share their views and stay connected. In my opinion, social networking sites have had more positive impact on individuals and society, than negative impact. Considering the positives, social networking sites have provided many small scale private businesses a platform to advertise and gain clientele. Platforms like instagram, facebook, whatsapp and pinterest have now become official sites for certain local businesses where they can easily connect to their local customers and save on store setup cost. With the freedom social media sites give, individuals now have the power to raise their voice for or against issues/initiatives being taken in the city or on a global level. Individuals are now empowered to give immediate feedback to actions taken by people in power and get to know live events as they happen. Keeping these points in mind, there is a downside to usage of social media sites as well. As it is known overuse of anything, will have an adverse effect on us. In this era, the youth in particular, have around 15 hours screen time per day because of their excessive usage of social networking sites especially instagram. This is unhealthy as constant usage of the device causes health hazards like spondylitis, eye power fluctuations and so on. If the usage of social media can be restricted so that it doesn’t affect the person’s physical or social wellbeing, social networking sites can do wonders. Overall, the positive impact of proper utilization of social networking sites on individuals and society, overweighs it’s negative impact. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some people seem to possess amazing prowess right from their birth. It is also stated that a child can be trained to become a successful sportsperson or musician. I believe that some individuals are indeed innately talented but coaching received during childhood can produce astounding results. The spectacular abilities that some people possess may be attributed to genetics. The ease and consistency with which some people excel especially in the fields of sports and music elucidate that talent is inherited. For example, analysts reveal that Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps’ torso and feet are naturally accentuated to swim effortlessly. In the field of music, there have been numerous success stories of gifted artists. For instance, singer Justin Bieber rose to fame meteorically with his first song and music album.  Notwithstanding that some abilities are inbred, I feel that determination and passion are also necessary. A dexterous child, if not mentored properly, may never take his or her potential to the next level. We also tend to overlook the training that high-fliers receive at a young age. For example, the grueling coaching sessions of Indian tennis star PV Sindhu during her school days make it evident that a pupil’s talent can be created. To cite another example, cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar first scored his century at the age of 16 years and broke several records. He accredits all his accomplishments to his childhood coach. In conclusion, I suppose that some dexterous individuals are special and naturally gifted. However, proper guidance and mentoring can also transform a child’s eagerness to acquire talent. Dedication and enthusiasm also play an important role. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Governments and private organizations across the world are continuing to invest a lot of money in space exploration; however, many people disagree with this. There are valid arguments on both sides, which we will discuss now. On the one hand, people who oppose space travel point out that it is better to utilize that funding for solving more pressing issues on earth, such as poverty and over-population which are threatening the very existence of mankind. Opponents also argue that space pollution is causing a negative effect on the environment.  They point out examples of recent shuttle launch, which burnt tons of fuel and left a lot of debris in the outer atmosphere resulting in a lot of space junk.  On the other hand, proponents argue that space exploration is a must because it gives mankind a chance to survive in case of a catastrophic event. Furthermore, they point out that relocating to another planet or solar system can only be possible through space travel. Supporters also point out the discoveries made in recent times and the advancements in the field of science and technology which were achieved by the International space station.  Overall, it appears that governments and private organizations should continue to fund space exploration since it has numerous benefits such as promoting technological advancements, improving living standards on earth and increasing the survival chances of humans in the event of a major natural catastrophe that makes our planet inhabitable. However, there is no justification for funding space programmes at the expense of other social welfare schemes.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Nowadays, computers have become an indispensable teaching tool in educational centres. I believe that the biggest benefit of using computers in education is the ability to provide audio-visual content students. In my opinion, the advantages of doing so far outweigh the minor disadvantages caused by the excessive use of computers.  First and foremost benefit of using computers in school is that it has the provision of audio-video aid which helps students to comprehend subjects more effectively. This is because of the fact that children are more receptive of visual presentations and connect to them more quickly as they are attractive and easy to remember. As a result, pupils are able to understand complex concepts with efficacy and hence, consequently do well in exams. For instance, in a survey it was reported that students who learn subjects through computers have a strong hold of basics compared to students who do not use it. The primary drawback of computers is that it can take a toll on the health of children, especially those who spend too much time on it. This is because the monitors of computers reflect rays that could directly impact the eyes of the pupils and in turn affect their vision. For example, in a survey it was reported that 28% of learners were afflicted with vision problems / changes caused by watching computer screens for a long time. In conclusion, although computers might affect the eyesight of learners who use it beyond the limit, the positives it provides to pupils by helping them learn and understand different topics more easily is invaluable. Therefore, in my opinion, the advantages of using computers in education outweigh the disadvantages. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In the present age, globalization is playing an increasingly important role in our lives. But in the meantime whether it is a blessing or a curse has sparked a heated debate. Some people argue that globalization has a fundamentally beneficial influence on our lives, while many others contend that it has a detrimental effect as well.A convincing argument can be made about globalization not only playing a pivotal role in the development of technology and economy, but also promoting the cultural exchange between different countries. To start with, it is the globalization that impelled many  to become international groups, thereby making a contribution to the local technology and employment. Specifically, when a multinational group  a factory in a developing country, the new equipment, the new management skills and the job vacancies are all in the best interest of the local society. Moreover, people worldwide can get to know each other better through globalization. It is easy to see that more and more Hollywood blockbusters show cultures different from American, some recent examples are ‘Kungfu Panda’ and ‘The Mummy’.Admittedly, the profit driven side of globalization has severely affected young people. Today, in the metropolises in different countries, it is very common to see teenagers wearing NIKE T-shirts and Adidas footwear, playing Hip-Hop music on Apple iPods and eating at KFC. The culture that took a thousand years to form just seems similar in these cities; it seems as though you can only distinguish them by their language. Meanwhile, in some developing countries, sweat workshops are always a concerning issue. For instance, reports show that some teenagers employed by NIKE’s contractors work in smelly factories over 14 hours a day, but are only paid fifty cents per hour.To sum up, I would concede that globalization does come with some adverse effects. Despite that fact, benefits created by it far outweigh the disadvantages. Overall, I am convinced that we should further promote globalization and meanwhile the local government should take measures to combat culture assimilation and sweat workshops.",8,False,102.71620227038184,334
"Nowadays, travelling has become much easier than in the past. People are travelling from one place to another place due to a variety of factors such as globalisation. Travelling assists  us to learn various cultures and it helps in promoting the travel industry. Globalisation is one of the main reasons for the increase in travelling. Nowadays, people are travelling due to various reasons, such as education, business and recreation. Globalisation has opened up the boundaries of the countries and provided ample opportunities. It is through globalisation that we are now able to expand our scopes of horizon across other nations. For instance, it is seen that students are applying to international colleges for further studies, this is mainly because of globalisation and it is noticed that there are more students enrolling for international studies than in the past. There are many benefits that we get while travelling. One of the merits is that we learn about many different cultures and this actually assists us in making our bonds with other nations stronger. We also learn to respect the culture and values of other nations. This further assists us in showcasing our own culture on an international platform.

However, others assert that unpaid service acts as a distractor and has negative impacts on the career prospects of a youngster. In my opinion, the young adults ought to engage in voluntary community service as it teaches them empathy and valuable social and team skills.  People who are against children participating in community service assert that it is a fruitless activity. Education plays a critical role in the making of a successful person. To score high grades in academics, a student needs perseverance and adequate time to focus on studies. If an individual spends more time in community services, it will become physically and mentally difficult for him to devote enough time to studies, and it will affect their academic result and make future prospects bleak. While this is certainly a downside, in my opinion, this problem can be mitigated by reducing the amount of time spent on community service.  On the other hand, there are several benefits to engaging in unpaid work. To start with, it enables teenagers to get a better understanding of the world outside. These days children often lead a cocooned life wherein their needs are taken care of the parents. When they get out and help the society through their work, they get to know the problems affecting others. This is a great opportunity for them to develop empathy and social commitment. They also learn many other valuable skills like team management, problem solving and communication. All of these skills will stand them in good stead when they enter the workplace in future. In conclusion, unpaid community service benefits young people in many ways. In my opinion, children should be engaged to volunteer during their free time. This will not only make them useful citizens but also teach them valuable social and communication skills.",8,False,103.6231884057971,325

Some people recommend that female leadership should be preferred to/over male leadership as there were fewer wars and less violence when women were in power. However, I disagree with the above statement because wars happen due to human greed and have nothing to do with the gender of the leader. The major reason for my disagreement with the statement that female leadership will bring peace is that wars are not initiated by gender related aggression; rather they are a result of the greed of humans. It is human nature to want more and more and when that greed is not satisfied, conflicts happen. History is replete with examples which prove that all wars were fought with the objective of seizing land, water, gold or riches. The fact that female leaders have shown no fewer acts of cruelty than male leaders is another reason for not supporting female leadership as a prerequisite for maintaining peace. For example, Rani Laxmi Bhai, a famous war heroine from India, showed no mercy to her enemies despite being a woman. The only reason why history had fewer wars under female leadership is because in older times most people hesitated to follow a woman; consequently, there were fewer wars when women were in power. In conclusion, conflicts and battles happen due to human greed and not due to human gender; also if we study history it is not hard to see that female leaders behave in the same way as male leaders when it comes to warfare, and hence leadership shift from males to females will not make the world a more peaceful place.",7,False,68.73998202462695,306
"Constant migration toward the big cities has become a common phenomenon all over the world. To prevent this, national authorities are encouraging/instigating industries and businesses to move to the suburbs. Although, this trend has minor drawbacks, the positive outcomes certainly overweigh them. To start with, the development of metropolitan cities and the opportunities available there has attracted a large number of people from rural areas. Unfortunately, this migration of rural people into urban areas has created problems like traffic congestion and lack of basic facilities in cities. Encouraging people to move back to their native places is the only solution to this problem and the only way to achieve this is to create job opportunities in the countryside. Hence, governments are encouraging industries to set up their offices and factories in the rural areas.  This trend will shoot up employment and career opportunities in less competitive markets and at the same time it can address the problems of housing and overcrowding in cities. Since people don’t have to move or travel far for job, the road traffic will come down automatically. This will reduce pollution and improve air quality in metropolises. In addition to this, flourishment of development in country side will equal economic growth of all the areas. In the end, country will progress as a whole.  However, there is a downside to the industrialization of villages. It will cause air and water pollution there. However, in my opinion this problem can be solved to a great extent by ensuring proper waste management. Some people are also worried that urbanization will destroy the local culture. Nevertheless, these are small prices to pay for development.  In a nutshell, in spite of a few drawbacks, the idea of starting new ventures in non-urban areas can be a great solution to stop the human migration and bring equal prosperity and growth in all parts of the nation.

However, in recent years the number of children suffering from obesity has grown significantly. There are several causes and numerous solutions which can be used to tackle this worrying phenomenon, and this essay will present a couple of them.While some reasons for childhood obesity are genetic, others include poor food choices exacerbated by easy availability of fast food, insufficient physical activity and a history of family members being overweight. Unlike the former, the latter factors can be changed, if the adults in the child’s life gain awareness and are willing to take action.To begin with, health is a complex matter which requires a balanced approach. In other words, there isn’t a single solution to maintain health, on the contrary, it is rather a mixture of multiple factors, such as  and regular physical activity.

Lack of experience, forgetfulness, carelessness and poor fitness condition may be reasons for limiting age of drivers. On the other hand, I would think that age is only a small determinant and we need to look at more effective measure such as reducing number of vehicles on the road through car pool, implementing more stringent regulations on alcohol drink driving and possibly to revise on the standard of driving test for young and old drivers on the road. Many drivers who are stuck in traffic jams also have busy lifestyles and therefore tend to become very stressed or distracted on the road. Thus I would think the government may have to look ways to improve road infrastructure and traffic jams to deter or reduce accidents on the road.To sum up, age is only one of the many contributors for accidents but I do not agree that  age for the elderly and raising age limit for the younger drivers is the best method. As mentioned in my third paragraph, we need to look at other more effective measures which deal with the underlying problems in the society which lead to traffic accidents.",6,False,67.96280087527352,261
"Some people prefer to live in an independent house; however, others believe that an apartment is more convenient and suitable for the fast paced urban lifestyle. In my opinion, houses are more spacious but apartments are better because their maintenance costs are considerably low. On the one hand, apartments are not spacious and do not provide the option to extend the area of rooms. In other words, apartments are constructed in a very limited space, and there is no possibility to design the rooms, whereas the rooms in an independent or duplex house are large and spacious and can be designed according to the requirements of the owner. For example, an independent house in New York comes with three spacious master bedrooms, an entertainment area, and a private garden, while an apartment comes with only a living room, a kitchen and a small bedroom. On the other hand, an apartment has low maintenance costs and thus it saves money for the owners. This is to say that people who own an apartment do not have to pay for property taxes and any other repair costs that are related to plumbing and electricity. On the contrary, people living in a house pay for all household repairs and maintenance of the house, and this can put an additional financial burden on the owner. For example, research revealed by The Guardian revealed that every year an independent house owner in America pays $12,000 property taxes, whereas a flat owner pays only $1,200.   In conclusion, an independent house can provide the owner with an option to design a spacious house.

"It is thought by many people that the personal details of a prospective employee could be beneficial; others, however, opine that it is irrelevant and employers should not seek these details. While there are several benefits to asking for the information pertaining to the interviewee, in my opinion, the disadvantages of this practice outweigh the advantages. Many people argue that the information about a candidate has uses. By gathering this data, an employer can match the candidate’s skills to the job. For instance, if a person is brilliant in mathematics and can solve the numerical problem, he could be a perfect choice for a job requiring calculation of figures and interpretation of results. As a result, the costs involved in training a new joiner could be reduced significantly and the employer could leverage the ability of his employee to improve his business performance and increase the revenue. However, gathering this information may do more harm than good. Firstly, the the personal data of the employee could be misused. For instance, the phone number and residential address of the female employees could get leaked which otherwise would have stayed confidential. This situation could be detrimental to the employee. Secondly, interest and hobbies of a person does not reveal his aptitude or skills. For example, a person with the desired skills may be short tempered and may lose his cool in a situation which requires urgent attention. A liar may conceal the truth and fabricate his personal details to get the job. In conclusion, even though the employer may gain an insight into the candidate’s personal details, this data may not be relevant and could do more harm than good. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to some people competitive sports should be included in the school curriculum as one subject whereas others think that it can be disadvantageous to kids. I think this move has more pros than cons and schools ought to have competitive sports as a subject.  Having competitive sports such as football or swimming as a part of school curriculum can bring several benefits to children. Firstly, doing sports as a compulsory subject in schools can make youngsters fitter and more athletic and this will improve their physical health not only in their childhood but also in their adulthood. Research studies have shown that working out and doing physical exercise can help brain development; therefore, children who do sports will be physically and mentally healthier than those who do not engage in regular physical exercises. Moreover, playing a team sport such as football develop team spirit in children and teach them how to be a good team member. These are skills essential for their success in future. On the other hand, having competitive sports as a subject in schools can lead to some problems as well. Children can sustain injury while playing games in competitive manners. In addition, sometimes, kids can become obsessed with winning all the time rather than enjoying the sports and team work. Besides, children who lack talents or skills in sports can lose self-esteem and this can have negative effects on their lives.  In conclusion, having competitive sports as part of school curriculum can bring both benefits and drawbacks for school children. However, in my opinion, the positive effects for children playing competitive sports at schools outweigh negative outcomes and schools should implement this policy for the sake of children.

"Since the advent of industrialization, there is a huge rise in the competition levels across the world. In fact, this change has lead to an increase in the number of working hours at the workplace, and some people insist that the nations with increased working times have developed financially more than those countries which do not extend their working hours. I strongly disagree with this viewpoint and this essay will elaborate on the same in the following paragraphs with relevant examples. To commence with, the employees working more than the regular / fixed hours are unlikely to have the ideal work-life balance. This explicitly has an adverse effect on their health and wellbeing and consequently impacts the work productivity. For instance, extensive research conducted by Times of India has revealed that several companies in India where employees are forced to work overtime have reduced productivity. The study also mentioned that this phenomenon has a negative impact on the overall economy of the country. One more reason why prolonged working hours do not improve a country’s financial status is the negative impact the long hours has on the health of the employees. This is because weary workers are more likely to develop various kinds of chronic diseases in their lifetime. Needless to say, unhealthy citizens directly or indirectly limit the growth prospects of the country. To exemplify, Russia has a great number of highly intelligent working people but at least one out of the five working professionals are suffering from a chronic disease such as diabetes and high blood pressure.  To conclude, workers working more than the usual hours do not make a country economically well-developed because the extensive hard work decreases employees’ work-life balance and also leads to their poor health condition.",8,False,87.07164790174002,291
"Economic progress is a significant goal for every government worldwide. Some leaders argue that it is the most essential task that should be achieved. However, according to some individuals, there are also other types of progress that are equally important for a nation. This essay will explain why several governments argue that economic growth is of the utmost importance and also explore reasons why other types of progress are deemed to be just as significant. To begin with, the economy of a particular nation is a measurement on how advanced it is in terms of general development. This is the reason why most governments deem / consider it as the number one priority when it comes to goal achievement. An example of it would be the comparison between a third world nation and a first world country. A third world country is ranked lower in terms of development compared to a first world country because it has lower GDP, which is an economic measurement of the performance of a country.  On the other hand, some individuals argue that there are other types of progress that are also as important as economic progress. An example of this would be educational progress. To some people, educational progress leads to economic progress. When governments prioritise the improvement of the educational system, it will produce professionals who secure better paying jobs.  They will provide a good return on investment for the country by paying higher taxes.  In conclusion, economic progress is a government priority because it gives them a better position in terms of worldwide rankings. At the same time other types of progress, such as educational development, are similarly important because it culminates in economic progress as well. In my opinion, economic progress and the other types of progress should be viewed as equals because improvement does not only result from improving one aspect of a nation; rather it requires the development of various aspects of life.

"It is thought by many that children should allocate much of their leisure time to their parents, while others believe that they should enjoy themselves outside as it is more significant. In my opinion, spending quality time with parents is more important than being outside. This essay will delineate both sides of the view with valid arguments and examples. People who believe that youngsters should spend more time at home have their justifications. This is because parents can inculcate moral values and ethics to their young ones. Moreover, it helps in creating strong bonding between families. In contrast, if they do not spend quality time with their loved ones, their bonding will not be strong enough. Studies have shown that children who spend more time with their parents have better manners than their counterparts. Thus, spending leisure time with families is of utmost importance.  On the other hand, some people think that going outside is equally vital. Youngsters can indulge themselves in some physical activity and live a healthier life. In addition to that, it helps them to interact with the outer world and make new friends. However, people who do not interact much outside of their families while growing up will fail miserably in making real connections at their workplace.  To conclude, although spending time outside helps them to interact with people and make new connections, the values that parents can teach in a family setting are invaluable. I believe that young ones should not only devote their free time to their family, but also manage to take some time from their busy schedule for themselves.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Many people argue that disadvantages of having a car outweigh its advantages. I completely agree with this view / argument, as despite offering comfort and being helpful in life threatening situations, a car needs heavy maintenance and causes environmental pollution. On the one hand, it is true that owing a car means you can have an enjoyable journey. A person can have a spacious seat to sit on, listen to music and enjoy privacy in an air-conditioned ambience and thus make their ride comfortable, unlike on the public transport where people do not even have enough room to stand due to overcrowding, especially during peak hours. Moreover, personal vehicles are always beneficial during emergencies. To illustrate, if a family member is sick and needs medical help during odd hours, when finding cabs, trains or buses is extremely difficult, having a car is indeed a boon. On the other hand, it is an irrefutable fact that four wheelers are not pocket friendly. Fuel and maintenance are additional expenses associated with car ownership. People from the middle socioeconomic background often get into financial instability due to this add on expenditure. Furthermore, automobiles need fuel to run, which on burning causes release of carbon dioxide and other toxic gases that are harmful to the environment. These fumes not only cause global warming but also worsen air pollution. If people limit the use of personal cars and start using public vehicles, this problem of rise in global temperature will be mitigated to some extent. In conclusion, although cars provide comfort and can be quite beneficial in emergency situations, their maintenance costs and perilous impact on the planet cannot be ignored. Hence, in my opinion, there are more disadvantages than advantages to cars. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free",8,False,146.73684210526318,304
"The managers and the chairmen of most of the institutions and organizations are older adults. It is generally argued that youngsters could manage these positions better than older people. However, I do not agree with this argument because of three different reasons. Firstly, it is obvious that youths are less experienced and have least exposure to the world and the organization. With hardly any experience they will not be able to lead the organization to reach its vision and this could probably result in the closure of the company. For example, when young and inexperienced people start a company, they may taste some success initially. But as the business grows, their lack of experience may lead to problems and the company could shut down.  Therefore, it is evident that older people can do better than younger ones.  Secondly, it is a matter of fact that the youngsters are energetic, talented and judgmental. They not only make quick decisions but also end up investing in some unrelated stuffs without thinking. This is not the case with elders. They think numerous times before they make any decisions. For instance, my grandfather takes at least one day to decide anything related to the family. This behavior not only aids him to make the best decisions but also teaches his kids about the importance of patience. Hence, it is proved that elders make better decisions and help in the success of the company. Finally, it is widely accepted that youth today are easily attracted towards the outside worldly life. If this is their mindset, then it is not beneficial for the progress of the company. For example, a negative comment on Facebook or Instagram may enrage a young proprietor and their thoughtless response could lead to many problems for the company.  This kind of attitude not only ruins the person but also their business. Therefore, seniors who have sound knowledge on everything should be on top position to guide others and this will lead to the success of the organization. To conclude, it is clearly evident that if seniors were in top levels of an organization then the company would reach its vision.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"At the time when famines heavily strike impoverished third world countries, many people living in wealthy countries waste tremendous amounts of food daily. In my opinion, understanding the probable reasons of this phenomenon is important and may lead us to some applicable solutions that will result in reducing food waste.The low cost of food seems to be one of the obvious reasons, exacerbating the problem. Due to the revolutionary technological achievements, people have increased both the quality and the quantity of their crops. In turn, according to the laws of supply and demand, the prices of the crops have immensely dropped. A recent study of the FAO stated that the global crops prices have dropped 50 per cent over the last decade. This enabled people to buy excessive amounts of food without a real need.Furthermore, the absence of strict regulations to discourage or punish this attitude can also be considered a major cause. Not everyone is aware that wasting food may create problems. Consequently, they are likely to resist any calls for controlling the consumption of dietary supplies unless they are forced by the power of law. Several countries in the world saw a drop in their national food waste after implementing a ban on the excessive purchasing of food.Fortunately, there are some possible approaches that can be adopted by both people and governments. Firstly, raising the awareness of this issue is immensely important. Using social media platforms can draw public attention to the potential dangers of food waste and how communities can confront it. Secondly, enforcing laws that prohibit the wasting of food by people and companies will deter such harmful practice.In conclusion, the decreased price of food as well as lack of regulations allowed the unfortunate trend of throwing away food to continue. I believe that creating awareness and legislation are parts of a straightforward solution to this issue.",8,False,73.04597701149424,310
"Although some people think that space research does not provide much value because it has not been able to find life on any other planet, in my opinion, it has benefitted humans in many ways. A major contribution of space travel is the exploration of the universe. In ancient times, people were not aware of the common facts related to our earth and other planets. Even the shape of the earth was not confirmed and space travellers made it possible by clicking photographs from the space. The search operations conducted by the researchers contributed to greater understanding of the galaxies in the space. Furthermore, these findings helped us to study the geographical features of our planet, which are important to determine the weather conditions or predict natural disasters. Heavenly bodies such as asteroids or comets often collide with one another and then their pieces may fall on earth causing destruction. With the help of space research we can detect such threats in advance and take measures to protect our earth.  Not only this, some beliefs in supernatural powers have also been eradicated from the minds of people as they can comprehend the universe with facts, figures and photographs. In addition to this, space travel is an intriguing area of science and attracts many youngsters to join this field. Because there is too much to explore, coming generations can have better career prospects in this sector. In conclusion, I firmly believe that space travel made so many contributions and in future there are possibilities of finding life on other planets. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The general argument is that parents know what is best for their children but this is not always the case. For example, there are still many parents who choose not to vaccinate their children. While some people argue that parents should have the option to opt out of child vaccination programmes, I believe that the government should make it illegal for parents not to immunize their children. Of course, not every child is a candidate for vaccines and some exceptions should be made. Some kids are born physically weaker than other kids. For this reason, their parents should consult medical experts prior to getting their children immunized to prevent unwanted side effects. For example, children who are diagnosed with some genetic disorders should not be given vaccines that can cause more harm than good. Next, isolated tribes that are cut from the outside world should also be exempt from vaccinations. For instance, the Amazonians are living in the deep jungle of Brazil and they have no contacts with outsiders; hence, they are not exposed to many diseases that typically affect children. As a result, modern vaccines are deemed unnecessary for these people who live in isolation. On the other hand, since the vast majority of children benefit from vaccination, it is the duty of the government to ensure that they have access to it. One way of achieving this is to make it compulsory for parents to immunize their children. This will not only ensure that children are given the best possible protection against incurable illnesses, but also help to prevent the spread of some diseases. For example, polio has been successfully eradicated due to government intervention that made polio vaccination compulsory in the 1950’s. In many parts of the world, there are still parents who choose not to provide vaccinations to their children because of superstitions and various socio-religious reasons. Making vaccinations mandatory is the only way to ensure that all kids have access to lifesaving shots. The government should also make vaccination certificates mandatory for admission to schools. In conclusion, vaccinations help save lives and the only way to ensure that all kids have access to them is to make it a legal requirement. Of course, children should be exempted from receiving vaccinations in cases where the downsides of receiving the shots outweigh the benefits.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Primary schooling is the age when children discover their talents and learn new skills. Hence some people insist that in addition to academic subjects, non-academic subjects like art and music should be taught at primary school. I fully agree with this view.  To begin with, primary classes are considered a crucial part of education, as children learn basic life skills at this time. To explain further, children learn faster during the age between 5 and 11 than any other time, so if arts subjects are taught during this time frame they may develop an interest in these areas. If they discover their talent for singing or acting at a very young age, they may even be able to pursue a career in those fields. For instance, most of the famous musicians started learning music at a very young age and this led them to choose it as a career. So it is important that these arts subjects are taught at a young age. In addition to the aforementioned benefit, art subjects when integrated with core subjects can make the learning process more interesting. To further elaborate, art subjects can be linked to core subjects for making learning fun. For example linking maths and music can help children understand concepts like counting, rhythm, harmonies, scales and patterns etc. So integrating academic and non-academic subjects can help students to understand concepts clearly. Also art subjects have the power to refresh the student’s body and mind and thus contribute to better learning outcome. Therefore, the importance of art subjects cannot be overlooked.  To conclude, it is important to teach art subjects at primary school because they help students to beat academic pressure and discover talents that they can develop into a career.

"It is argued that at present many juveniles prefer to spend more time with their peers than their parents. The main reason for this trend is the age gap, and I do not think that mothers and fathers should compel their children to spend more time at home because it can develop a sense of resentment amongst children. When children reach their adolescence, their thinking and preferences often change. Consequently, they and their parents fail to agree upon most things.  They may feel that their guardians are old-fashioned and do not share any common interest with them. As a result, they find it boring to spend time with them  and instead choose to hang out with their friends because they may share various common likes. Additionally, a few young people reside in hostels with their friends while studying in universities away from their parents, and sometimes, they may become used to spending all the time with their roommates. As a result, they do not give much preference to be at home. If children are enforced to spend more time at home, this practice can create bitterness in their minds against their parents.  This is because many young people do not like to be controlled and forced to listen to edifications by their elders. If they are restrained, it may result in them becoming ill- mannered. For example, studies have shown that children who are grounded by their parents are more likely to show unpredictable / aggressive behaviour. However, parents can engage themselves in some kind of activities that their children like such as watching their favourite TV shows with them to motivate them to spend time at home. In conclusion, many young adults choose to spend less time with their families because of age difference and uncommon preferences / interests. I believe that youngsters should not be made to spend more time at home because they can develop disruptive behaviour.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to some people, the authorities should invest in trains instead of roadways. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, roads are as important as railways and hence the government should allocate appropriate funding for both.  There are certainly ample reasons to spend taxpayer’s money on railways. Trains can carry more people. Also, they are eco-friendly. Unlike cars or buses they do not emit poisonous gases which pollute the air. Another advantage of using trains is that they do not get stuck in traffic. People can reach their destinations on time. Trains also tend to be faster and safer. Better still, in most countries around the world, train fares are considerably lower than bus fares or taxi fares.  On the flip side, roads are equally important. The construction of railways is not possible in certain geographical areas and in such places roads are the only mode of transport for people. Also, rail networks cannot reach every nook and corner of a country. Actually, most people use both roads and railways to commute to college or work. For example, they may take the bus or car to reach the railway station and from there they may take the train to reach their office.  If there are no roads or if the existing roads are in a pathetic condition, people will have trouble reaching their destinations.  In conclusion, roadways and railways are both essential for making travelling hassle free for people. Hence, I do not agree with the argument that the government should invest more on railways. Rather, it should give equal importance to both modes of transport. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Nowadays, environmental issues have become a major topic of discussion among people and governments. Many individuals / people argue that environmental protection can be achieved only by the governments or large business conglomerates. I strongly disagree with this opinion as small movements can have a big impact. Also any individual effort for the protection of the environment will be highly appreciated and supported by the public and this will increase the momentum. Even though, the majority of individuals think individual efforts are useless, they have a great impact on a bigger picture. For example, in the waste management process segregating the household garbage items will take only a few minutes for the person who is sending the waste materials to the government agencies, but it provides a greater advantage for the government bodies since it is easier for them to process the properly separated waste materials. If everyone thinks that they cannot make any difference, there will not be any positive move. Therefore it is important for everyone to do whatever they can to protect the environment. In addition, if individual efforts to protect the environment are highlighted through the proper channel, they will inspire many more people to follow the same path. For example, in 2017, Mr. Prashant, the then district collector of Kozhikode, took the personal initiative to clean a public lake in the district and he publicized / promoted the campaign on his Facebook page. After hearing about this, hundreds of local community persons joined the movement and made it a success. If that person was waiting for the government to take action, this would not happen. This clearly shows that any minor initiatives, especially for the betterment of the environment will receive a huge support from the public if we publicize it properly. To conclude, small efforts made by the individuals for the protection of the environment certainly make a difference and encourage others also to contribute. In the light of this we can strongly oppose the given argument which underestimates individual efforts, and clearly state that individual contribution is as much important as the support provided by government bodies and multinational companies.

"It is true that education plays a vital role in ensuring the prosperity of a nation. While some people believe that merely educating the masses can lead a country towards success, others argue that several other factors are equally important. I completely agree with the former statement and this essay will highlight how education propels a country towards economic and social progression.  First and foremost, educational institutions produce professionals, so that they may contribute to the betterment of the economy. For example, in Japan, from a plumber to a nuclear scientist one cannot work as a professional unless one undergoes the required practical training and obtains the mandatory certificate, degree or diploma from the concerned academic body. This practice helps educators and economists to work together and form beneficial economic policies since the entire data related to a worker’s roles and responsibilities, compensation and benefits, career progression and the like is available to them.  Secondly, a proper education system promotes high moral values which contribute positively to the development of a society. In addition, educated people are more aware of their rights and responsibilities and this enables to work together for the welfare of their nation. Education also helps eradicate corruption. It makes people aware that good governance is their right and then they will not want to pay bribes for getting things done. Educated people also tend to be healthier because they know what is good and bad for their health. In conclusion, although there may be several factors that affect a country’s well-being, in my opinion, the education system is the cornerstone of economic and social progress.

"In both developing and developed countries, people often debate how much a person can earn. Some people argue that there should not be any restriction imposed on the earnings of the people as higher salaries benefit the nation. However, others tend to differ and feel that the government should cap the salaries of their citizens to reduce disparity in income.  On the one hand, it is often argued that people should be paid according to their caliber. They think that higher salary improves the standard of living which in turn contributes to the development of their nation. The higher salaried person will end up paying more income tax which is usually the major source income for the government authorities. The money collected from the tax is usually used for the development of the nation. Hence a higher salary is good for their motherland. For instance, in India, companies like Microsoft and Google are offering a handsome salary to their employees. While their employees are among the best paid in the world, they are also the highest taxpayers in the country. On the other hand, many believe that the government should restrict the amount that their residents earn. The salary gap between them should not exist as it brings instability in the society. They prefer to keep a uniform pay-range for every job as it makes their economy stable. It reduces poverty and the gap between the rich and the poor. For instance, in Canada, every job has a minimum and maximum pay scale and their citizens are paid in that range. And because of this, Canada has become one of the most stable economies. To recapitulate, many people across the world have relatively higher salaries which contribute to the development of their motherland. However, there are many countries like Canada, which has put up a pay range in order to maintain better parity in income. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"During childhood, kids must learn about right and wrong. One way of making them know the difference is to punish them when they do something wrong. In my opinion, I agree that punishments go a long way in shaping a child’s future and keep them in the right path. The fear of punishment will encourage students to stay away from wrongdoings and hence they will not get into any problems with their friends or teachers. This will make their school life free of issues and confrontations which will eventually make them perform well in school. For example, a kid punished for stealing a pencil from his classmate is unlikely to do that in future because of the embarrassment he faced the last time he did it. When these children grow up into adults they will always strive to do the right thing and they will stay away from the wrong path due to the lessons learned in their childhood. Admittedly, this will make them impart their values to their children also.  On the whole, the society will benefit from people like these.  Punishments do not necessarily have to be severe. For example, parents can cancel an outing or refuse to buy a birthday gift for their child. Teachers can give impositions or ask the kid to sit in the class during a physical training period.  In conclusion, children ought to know what is right and what is wrong. Parents and teachers can punish them in order for the children to correct their behaviour. This would build a better society of people who do only right things.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"According to some people lessons that we learn from our life through various experiences are enough to ensure our success. I do agree with this view to a certain extent. Some of the most successful people in the world received no formal schooling and yet they made a name for themselves by learning from their mistakes and constantly improving their strategies. However, there are only a handful of such people and the vast majority of successful people that we see today are highly educated. In my opinion, formal schooling is as important as life lessons for ensuring the success of a person. There are certainly a lot of things that we can learn from our life. Life experiences teach us to constantly improve our game by learning from our mistakes. For example, some of the most successful businessmen, politicians and sportspersons of this and the previous century received hardly any formal education. However, they did not waste even a single opportunity to learn from their mistakes and constantly upped their game. Obviously, life lessons can help us succeed. On the other hand, very few people manage to succeed on the merit of the lessons they learned from life. The vast majority of successful people that we know today have fancy degrees from reputed international institutions. In this age of information explosion, academic learning is all the more important. Companies no longer recruit people who lack a degree. Hence, it is foolish to believe that life lessons alone will ensure our success in life and career.  In conclusion, lessons that we learn from our experiences are certainly important and play a crucial role in making us successful.

"Nowadays, more youngsters are engaged in online gaming than before. Many people assert that this has a negative impact on the gamer who wastes precious time and resources for this indulgence. However, I do not completely agree with this notion and believe that there are some positive aspects to gaming if it is done within limits. The main reason why people think computer games are bad is that they are addictive. Also, these games waste a lot of time. Instead of focusing on their careers and other important aspects of their young life, many get diverted and find themselves enslaved by their consoles. Sometimes these games pamper the ego of the gamer. Young people who lack a sense of achievement are also more likely to play these games because reaching higher levels enable them to feel better about themselves and their capabilities. Unfortunately, this kind of behaviour certainly does not help and they end up wasting invaluable hours in the virtual world, making them fall behind their peers in the real world. On the other hand, some benefits can be achieved by playing computer games. Firstly, it improves the reflexes and the strategic thinking capabilities of the user. Skills like eye-hand coordination, resource planning and team play can be improved by playing games and these skills come handy in life. In addition, gaming if taken seriously can be a viable career option and skilled gamers can be employed by multinational companies as testers and they can also win online gaming tournaments. Many professional gamers earn a handsome living by participating in international tournaments around the globe. Thus, if done sensibly and thoughtfully gaming could very well be a lucrative career option.  To conclude, the growing popularity of gaming among young adults is a matter of concern because it may have serious consequences when it becomes an obsession.

"According to some people, the onus is on governments and large industries to solve environmental issues, and not on individuals. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, everyone has the responsibility to contribute their bit to reverse environmental damage. Of course, governments and large corporations can do more, but this does not mean that individuals have no responsibility.  Governments can help solve environmental issues by enacting strict laws that prevent deforestation and illegal mining. For example, illegal sand mining has destroyed many rivers in India. Strict laws are needed to prevent this practice. Likewise, the clearing of forest land for building industries and residential spaces should be stopped with stringent laws. In addition, the government should support the use of renewable sources of energy like solar and wind. It can incentivize companies conducting research in this field and offer subsidies to encourage people to install solar panels on their rooftops. Promotion of electronic vehicles is another way to reduce environmental damage. Only governments can take such measures.  Industries are the biggest polluters and as such they have a greater role than anyone else to reverse at least some of the damage caused by them. They can do this by investing in eco-friendly technologies. Manufacturing companies must ensure that they do not dump untreated waste into water bodies. Likewise, they must limit the use of plastic for packaging. Large businesses can also drive various environmental promotion drives. Individuals like you and me have to contribute our bit too. We can do this by adopting responsible consumption. We must resist the temptation to buy products we do not need. We need to realize that our use and throw culture is causing a great deal of damage to the planet.

"There have been immense advances in technology in most aspects of people’s lives, especially in the field of education. Nowadays, an increasing number of students rely on computers for research and to produce a perfect paper for school purposes. Others have decided to leave the original way of learning and to get knowledge through online schools. These changes in the learning process have brought a special concern regarding the possible decrease of importance of teachers in the classroom.Some people believe the role of teachers started to fade because computers have been helping some students to progress in their studies quicker compared to studies in an original classroom. For example, in the same classroom, students have different intellectual capacities, thus some would be tied to a slow advance in their studies because of others’ incapability of understanding. In this way, pupils could progress in their acquisition of knowledge at their own pace using computers instead of learning from teachers.However, the presence of a teacher is essential for students because the human contact influences them in positive ways. Firstly, students realize that they are not dealing with a machine but with a human being who deserves attention and respect. They also learn the importance of studying in a group and respect for other students, which helps them improve their social skills.Moreover, teachers are required in the learning process because they acknowledge some students’ deficiencies and help them to solve their problems by repeating the same explanation, giving extra exercises or even suggesting a private tutor. Hence, students can have a better chance of avoiding a failure in a subject.In conclusion, the role for teachers in the learning process is still very important and it will continue to be such in the future because no machine can replace the human interaction and its consequences.",8,False,66.54421542553192,301
"Children’s behaviour and character almost always reflect what they have been taught by their parents and teachers. Since a person’s character is formed during their childhood, it is important for children to learn the difference between right. Many people opine that punishment is necessary for children to learn appropriate behaviour and values. I agree with this opinion to a great extent. One of the reasons to punish a child when they do something wrong is to make them aware of the immoral act right away. When they are punished they will realize that their act was unacceptable and this will deter them from repeating the same offence. For example, a child uttering foul language or bullying others, if immediately reprimanded, is less likely to attempt this misbehaviour again. As for the forms of punishments, in my opinion, parents and teachers should resort to only mild punishments. For example, at school, teachers can ask a child to stand outside the classroom. At home, parents can stop the child from watching their favourite TV show if they do not complete their homework or eat healthy food. Sometimes, an emotional punishment is even more helpful. For instance, parents can stop talking to their child for a while if they do something really bad. Another way of punishing is to instil in children the fear of loss. Some children are not afraid of getting beaten, but they will definitely not want to lose something dear to them. Parents, for example, can stop giving them their pocket money or prevent them from playing with their pets or friends if they misbehave. In conclusion, I feel that some sort of punishment is essential to guide the children about the difference between good and bad. However, at the same time, it should be ensured that harsh forms of corporal punishment such as beating or punching are not employed. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Every government allocates a certain proportion of its budget for the safety of its citizens. Some people opine that authorities should invest money to eradicate the root cause of crime while others assert that it ought to be spent on the punishment of criminals. In my opinion, uprooting the causes of crime is the most effective way to make the society safer. On the one hand, there are certainly some benefits to spending money on punishing the offenders in order to set an example in front of the public. Strict punishment is a lesson for people and it can create fear among them. As a result, they will not want to indulge in any kind of illegal activity. For instance, some nations have negligible incidences of rape because they follow stringent punishment procedures to tackle such cases. However, I believe that it is a less effective way because when people are about to commit a crime, they are not in a sober mood to think about the consequences. On the other hand, investing funds to eradicate the major causes of crime is a much more beneficial strategy because this will dramatically decrease the crime rate. The majority of illegal activities are performed by offenders due to the lack of insufficient funds and unemployment. If such problems are eradicated from the society by authorities, the crime figures will automatically drop. Moreover, investment in removing crime will lead to the foundation of an egalitarian society where people will be able to live peacefully and safely. Countries, where the crime rate is zero are the happiest and Finland is a prime example of this. This is much more effective than punishing people to set an example for others because people easily forget what happened to others.  In conclusion, although spending money on harsh punishment is a lesson for criminals and public, I think working on the main reason of crime is a much more effective strategy to eliminate crime completely as it will be better for the safety of people and for the progress of the country / the nation.

"Replacing daily meals with fast foods is becoming a norm in the modern world. People in the modern society are no longer cooking due to their busy schedules. In my opinion, this trend has more demerits than merits. To begin with, fast foods are made up of a high proportion of unhealthy ingredients such as unsaturated fats, oil and sugar. Frequent intake of these will cause obesity and health problems including diabetes and high cholesterol levels. In additional to that, fast foods have very low nutritional value and do not fulfill the requirements of a balanced diet. Hence, constant intake of fast foods may cause nutritional deficiency in the long term. This is especially harmful to children and teenagers whose bodies are still developing. Besides that, replacing proper meals with fast foods may also affect family bonding over dinner. Packaged fast foods are almost never eaten together sitting around a table. Rather youngsters and children alike consume them mindlessly sitting in front of the television or computer. The overuse of fast foods also eliminates any opportunity to cook together and talk. This lack of communication within the household affects family ties. Children may suspect that they are not close enough to their parents and stop sharing the issues they face at school. This may eventually cause behavioural problems in them. To conclude, I feel that the invention of fast foods is bringing more harms than good to the modern society. In my opinion, health and family bonding time are precious things and they should be the priorities of our lives at all times.",8,False,95.0503478624284,263
"More and more people are living alone these days. There are several reasons behind this trend and the most important among them are the need for freedom and the financial security that many people enjoy these days. In my opinion, living alone has both advantages and disadvantages. They are various reasons why many people prefer to live by themselves. To start with, they seek freedom and absolute control over their lives. They do not like it when their parents or siblings try to encroach on their personal space so they choose to live alone. Generation gap is another factor that contributes to this phenomenon. Oftentimes youngsters and their parents have widely different opinions on many things and this leads to conflicts. Living alone allows people to live as they wish. Another reason for this trend is the rapid economic development. Many people now earn more than enough to live on their own. Since they do not need the financial assistance of a parent or spouse, they choose to live by themselves. The advent of modern technologies like the internet and smart phone has also contributed to this trend. People are now ready to migrate to faraway lands because they are aware that they can stay connected to their near and dear ones from any part of the globe. On the one hand, this development can be advantageous for young people. When they live alone, they have to learn to cook, wash and manage their finances independently. If they live with their parents, they receive help all the time and this may prevent them from acquiring important life skills and becoming independent. On the other hand, living alone does not benefit the nurturing of family bonds. While it is true that we can now get in touch with our family from any part of the world, online interactions lack the warmth of real face to face interactions. Also, when youngsters choose to live on their own, their aging parents are left alone. Last but not least, too much freedom can be detrimental and it is quite possible for young people living alone to get into bad company. Thus, it is evident that this trend has a negative impact on family relationships in the long term. In conclusion, although living alone has become a popular trend and has its inherent advantages, people still need to pay attention to its disadvantages in order to sustain family bonds.

"In many countries, especially in cities, shopping has become the best way for teenagers to relax. It is because for many people it is an immediate and easy option and they do not have to plan in advance. I think this is a positive development and in this essay I will support my stand with valid arguments.  There are plenty of shopping malls in cities, which are a quick option for many people to spend their leisure time. It not only helps them to relax but also allows them to buy their necessities in their leisure time. According to a survey conducted by a magazine, 68% of young adults choose shopping as their first option whenever they feel bored or stressed out. And the survey also explained that 15% of them choose window shopping to chill out. In my opinion, it is largely a positive development, because shopping directly generates revenue for the government in the form of tax and creates employment. If they purchase goods, 5% to 15% of the bill will go to the government. As a result the government can also provide good facilities such as proper roads and safety to citizens. That is why most of the metropolitan cities encourage shopping malls and stores to increase their revenue. For example, in Hyderabad, GHMC doubled its revenue after it permitted 50 malls, which helped to renovate 20 parks and repair all the roads in city. In conclusion, shopping is the best way to relax as it requires hardly any planning. It also benefits the economy. However, youngsters need to take care not to spend beyond their means.

"Today in several countries we can see children as paid workers. While some individuals believe child labour should not be allowed, a few others encourage it considering it to be beneficial for a child’s development. However, in my opinion, children should not be allowed to work as it deprives them of their childhood. It is a fact that childhood is the most memorable phase of a person’s life. It is at this age that we enjoy leading the most care-free life playing and enjoying around unaware of the struggles of life. Children at this age should focus on learning and should have the opportunities to explore their areas of interest. Instead if children are forced to work they will never be able to identify their real capabilities and will end up doing the same job to which they are exposed. Another important fact is that most of the child labourers are usually exploited at their work places and are often mistreated by the employers. This is a major and serious concern as it adversely affects a child’s mind. Having bad experiences at a young age, sometimes develop a negative mindset in children and they are driven towards criminal activities. Hence, it is very crucial that children should have proper upbringing in a protective environment. Also, I believe that nations where child labour is widely practiced should adopt strict policies to have a restriction on the age limit. In conclusion, the practice of employing children as paid workers should not be encouraged in any country as it would prevent them from leading a healthy and safe childhood.",8,False,50.79931615776081,266
"Deforestation is a serious threat to the survival of all life forms on the planet. Atmospheric temperature is increasing and this has already led to the extinction of several species of plants and animals. If deforestation continues at the current pace, global temperatures will keep increasing and wreak havoc on planet earth. Yet, we choose to ignore the problems caused by the cutting down of trees. Although deforestation has some obvious benefits and is needed at times to continue our development, it needs to be monitored by authorities. The most compelling reason for supporting deforestation is the development of our society. Human race has developed continuously since the time we learnt to harness the power of natural resources.  Wood is an important natural resource with myriads of applications. We need abundance of wood in real estate; it is the prime source of fuel for many rural households; we also produce paper from wood. Obviously, this wood comes from trees. The greater the uses of wood, the higher the number of trees cut down. In addition, the growing population needs homes to survive, which also leads to deforestation and forest encroachment. In our bid to build homes for humans, we are encroaching upon the habitats of wild animals.  To conclude, deforestation should be regulated by authorities and should not be done in perfunctory manner. We should all understand the catastrophic impact of climate change and global warming. If we do not act now, our time on earth will be shortened. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate. ",8,False,66.24566905615293,269
"According to some people, charities should help only those people who live within their national boundaries; however, others opine that they should provide assistance everywhere. In my opinion, it depends on the mission of the organization and its resources. Well-funded charities can offer help everywhere; those that are short of resources should prioritize their own people.  On the one hand, if NGOs decide to serve only the people of their country, we cannot quite blame them. After all, their resources come from the local people and as such when this money is utilized for the benefit of the locals, it is fully justified. Charitable work focusing on local issues also satisfies donors who are eager to see a resolution to the problems affecting their country or community. Also, many charitable organizations have limited resources. For example, charities operating in poor countries are often short of resources. They cannot provide help abroad. If they attempt to do this, they will only antagonize the local community that funds their initiatives. On the other hand, there are many international organizations flush with cash and other resources. For instance, UNICEF is an international organization which aims to aid children worldwide. They receive funding from affluent countries and hence they are quite capable of offering assistance in any part of the world. There are several such organizations that have the backing of developed countries. It is their moral and constitutional responsibility to provide assistance to needy people everywhere.  To conclude, charities should work with the objective of helping the needy. Who they should help or where they should provide help depends on their financial situation and objectives.

"It is common sense that children should learn to distinguish between right and wrong from an early age. Some people believe that the easiest way to accomplish this is to punish them when they do something wrong. I completely disagree with this view. Children are too young to understand why they are punished. They are easy to link their mistakes to the unhappy experience after punishment. However, they still do not know why their parents are angry with them and how to correct their behaviour because they are not mature enough to reform themselves. Therefore, instead of giving them punishment, parents should have the patience to teach them what is right and explain related moral rules when their children make mistakes. With this approach, children can acquire a deep understanding. In addition, parents need to set good role models for their children; thus, children can copy right behaviour from parents. In sum, punishments make children confused, and children have no right model to follow. In addition, punishment has a negative effect on children. A better approach is to use encouragement to educate children because it has a positive influence on children. Encouragement gives children the space to try and explore and allow them to make mistakes. At the same time, parents should warn children when they are wrong and tell them what is right rather than punish them. That way they can boost children’s motivation to learn new things without worrying about making mistakes. By contrast, if children are punished when they make mistakes, they will lack a sense of security which is required for their normal development. As result of that, it is hard for them to make progress in the future since they always choose to do nothing to avoid mistakes. To conclude, punishment is unsuitable to help children learn the distinction between right and wrong and parents should find more understandable and beneficial ways to teach them good behaviour.",7,False,67.66477436124526,322
"Some people argue that since children get so much leisure time, they should utilize this by doing academic work. In my opinion, instead of spending free time doing educational work, teenagers should participate in sports because it promotes health and reduces stress. To begin with, adolescents should not engage in any educational study in their spare time because they already spend7-8 hours a day studying in schools and afterwards, when they get home they feel exhausted. If they are given more school assignments to solve at home, this will make them stressed out which is detrimental for their overall well-being. For example, an article published by ‘The Tribune’ newspaper shows that children who remain absorbed in their studies all the time are more likely to suffer from mental disorders. Young people should involve themselves in sports activities in their spare time for their mental as well as physical fitness. When minors go outside to play in the playgrounds they feel refreshed and free of worries which is extremely beneficial for their mental health. Also, playing outdoor games such as cricket and volleyball assists them to build up the physical strength and stamina. As a result, they feel active and perform well in their academics also. For instance, a recent study by Delhi University shows that children who remain engaged in some kinds of sports are healthier and more intelligent than those who do not play any sport. In conclusion, doing educational activities even in their spare time increases the pressure on children and hurts their mental and physiological development. Hence, teenagers should play some sports or engage in other enjoyable activities after school hours to stay healthy and happy. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Note that all band score estimates are approximate. It is undoubtedly true that nowadays a proper curriculum planning has become a vital part of education. Many people feel that it is important for the students to be taught drawing in school. In my personal opinion, I feel that a student’s time can be utilized much more effectively than wasting on learning arts. On the one hand, drawing or painting helps to enhance the creativity in children. This in turn helps them to build their imagination and can also broaden their horizon or way of thinking. It helps them to become better individuals in life. Also, being engaged in such an activity helps students to relax by breaking the monotonous job of studying academics. On the other hand, there are certain circumstances wherein the idea of including art in curriculum will not be welcomed by many pupils and parents. For instance, a child who is more interested in playing sports will feel that it is a waste of time to sit and draw. Instead it would be more rewarding if he invests his time in learning or practicing sports rather than drawing. Furthermore, the basic motive of many parents to send their children to school is for studying rather than co-curricular activities and hence they would want the school to focus on academics as against drawing. Hence, I feel that it will not be a good idea to teach drawing at schools because there are many classes outside schools which can be utilized for this purpose if at all a child is interested in it. In conclusion, I feel that it should not be made mandatory by schools to teach drawing, however it can be offered as an optional subject in the curriculum. This will enable the students to make a sagacious choice depending on whatever is best suited for them. Would you like to use our writing correction service?

"People have different opinions about whether watching TV has positive or negative impact on children. While good content on television is certainly beneficial for children, I believe that the negative effects are more pronounced than the advantages. On the one hand, there are some reasons why watching TV benefits juveniles in their education. First and foremost, there are too many shows that are produced exclusively for children either to entertain them or to provide them knowledge regarding particular subjects. For instance, the shows Scifact and Mathtricks are telecast to infuse knowledge of science and mathematics respectively among children in an entertaining way and children retain the facts and figures learnt in this way for much longer time compared to knowledge gained from books and teachers. Also, watching a television program is a lot more interesting for children than attending a dull class.  On the other hand, excess of everything is bad. Most of the channels are run 24 × 7 and because of the entertainment they provide, children are glued to the TV irrespective of the adverse effect it provides. Because of the excessive amount of time spent on watching TV, most of children these days are wearing specs. In addition to this, excessive screen time is a major cause of the obesity that can be seen in most of the children as they prefer watching their favourite shows to playing outdoor sports. And while watching they overeat unconsciously resulting in many health hazards at an early age of their life. Watching TV also distracts juveniles from studies as they find cartoons and children’s show more interesting than reading books and this certainly affects their scorecard. In conclusion, even though watching TV under parental supervision has some good impacts on children, I restate that excessive screen time is indeed detrimental for them.

"Owing to human activities, many species of wild animals are struggling to survive. This had driven many of them to the verge of extinction and others are on the endangered list. There are several reasons for this. On the bright side, there are also certain measures that we can take to resolve this problem. The main cause of extinction of the wild animals is deforestation which is done to facilitate the expansion and development of urban areas. Due to this, wild animals lose their natural habitat and this puts their lives at risk. Many of them are forced to wander into villages for food. However, since they pose a threat to people’s lives and property, they are often killed. Excessive poaching is another reason for the extinction of many wild animals. They are killed for the production of luxury goods such as leather bags, shoes and fur coats. There are several measures that the government and the public can take to undo the damage done to wildlife. First and foremost, the government should launch nationwide campaigns to sensitise people about the importance of conserving wildlife. In addition, there should be strict laws to prevent poaching. The media and the activists can also contribute their bit. They should discourage people from buying products made of animal skin or fur. To conclude, human activities such as deforestation and mindless hunting are the major reasons for the extinction of wildlife. By enacting strict laws that stop or at least reduce deforestation and poaching, wild animals can be saved from the brink of extinction.",7,False,61.9106463878327,260
"A great deal of time, effort and patience is required to develop good handwriting. In this era where most schools use tablets in the classroom, many parents and teachers believe that hand writing has lost its importance. After all when the computers do all the writing, there is no need for children to improve their handwriting. Unfortunately, this is a negative trend and schools that ignore handwriting are doing more harm than good to their students. Writing is an art that stimulates the brain. Consequently children who write with a pen or pencil tend to have more active and smarter brains. Also when they write with their hands, they have to learn the spelling and grammar. This improves their cognitive as well as language skills. Studies have also demonstrated links between a person’s handwriting and their character. People with good handwriting tend to be more organized and successful. They also tend to possess a greater clarity of thought. If schools and students ignore this important skill, it may not have any immediate impact on their grades. Unfortunately, these children who cannot write even a single word neatly will eventually face problems that could even hurt their career prospects. To start with, the technology that they depend on may fail them at times. If the network connection fails or their computer breaks down, their efficiency will take a severe backing. For example, many students these days cannot write a letter or draft a report if they do not have access to the internet and a computer. They don’t know the spelling of most words. They cannot write legibly. They do not have ideas either because their critical thinking skills are almost negligible. Whenever they have a question, they just search online and they don’t memorize anything. To conclude, students can ignore handwriting only at their peril. It is a skill that will stand them in good stead throughout their lives. It is hoped that parents and teachers will realize the importance of handwriting before it gets too late.",9,False,89.7666220943923,337
"Some believe that the government is the right authority to choose the subjects while others insist that students should be allowed to choose their subjects. In my opinion, the government can take better decisions than students because they have the guidance of experienced teachers and other experts. Nowadays, people feel that students are knowledgeable enough to decide what they want to study. They are not only aware of the suitable career options but also understand the means to achieve them. For instance, with the advent of social media they are well connected with college seniors and expert teachers from around the globe that all the latest developments in their field are well known to them. Overall, most of the students are intelligent enough to understand where they are heading. However, when it comes to designing courses, the government can take better decisions. This is because the government receives sound advice from teachers and educationists. In addition, they are also well aware of the job opportunities available within the country and outside of it. Consequently, they can design courses that offer better employment opportunities for children. By contrast, if students are given the right to choose their topics, they may opt for subjects they find interesting without considering the job prospects. To conclude, whether the subjects should be selected by the government or the students continues to be a debatable topic. This essay discussed why it is apt to give students this right and why giving that power to the government is a superior choice. In my opinion, the government has better exposure and understanding than students to decide what future generation should learn.",7,False,65.32862504706324,273
"The following essay was written by one of our students. It may contain grammar and spelling mistakes. It is merely provided as a sample. Sample essay Some argue that competitive attitude in children should be facilitated, while others claim that learning them how to co-operate with their peers would make them better adults. In my view, this is a sensitive issue to discuss, but I would prefer to have a competitive and a cooperative child, as the combination of these two characters will add to the child significantly. Firstly, competing with your class mates will enhance your performance intillectually and physically. For example, having a class of students full of motivation, and the desire to score full marks, will lead to a better atmosphere in the class, and increases the level of education. Similarly, when it comes to sports, competitive attitude is crucial to reach fame and success. On the other hand, raising children with the spirit of co-operation and giving a hand to the needy ones will create a society full of charity. Also, it will decrease number of crimes in that society. Teaching children how to deal with poor, injured, and handicapped people is an act of humanity. Conversely, a society full of selfish, greedy, and power-loving individuals will lead to moral collapse and a lot of social problems. Therefore, in my point of view, it is better to teach our children how to treat others rightly. Moreover, raising a young competitive generation will develop the society, and increase level of literacy. Eventually, these two results will yield economic growth, and financial benefits. In conclusion, children should be taught how to be successful in their lives. Raising children with good characters like helping others, and competing with others in different fields will put them on the right path for success and prosperity.

"In this era of technology, several mobile and internet applications have become popular among the people. As a result, a major share of the population is exploring various websites to find their soul mates. In my opinion, this trend is largely positive provided that users exercise caution.  Obviously, such websites act as a channel of communication for interested parties. To elaborate, people can have various sort of communication such as text messages, voice calls and video interactions; therefore these platforms make geographical and cultural barriers irrelevant. Tinder, one of the most popular online social websites, enshrines these features, and serves as a channel for finding potential partners and bonding with them. Therefore, it is an undeniable fact that the versatility of such cyber platforms is noteworthy. To continue, these sites allow people to share their preferences and fantasies with others, which cannot be expressed publicly. Therefore, people can effortlessly search for partners who share their interests. For example, even though homo-sexuality is   legalized in many nations, it is difficult for homosexual people to find suitable partners using conventional channels. It is possible through these sites. Hence, the opportunity to express personal preferences makes these platforms popular with people. In conclusion, although dating sites have features that make them prone to misuse, they are still popular among people because of their intrinsic features which enable a user to express their intimate feelings without having to worry about getting judged. In my opinion, these apps are beneficial as long as users use commonsense and do not trust anyone blindly. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Art is a core aspect of our heritage and epitome of our legacy. But recent statistics show that there is a decline of interest in the field of arts, as rapid technological advancements have lured youngsters and adults with the promise of flashy gadgets, powerful computers and so forth. In this essay, I intend to outline the major reasons for this shift and suggest a few ways in which people can be encouraged to invest more time in arts. Firstly, the major reason for people to focus on science and technology is their immense contribution in making the world a better place. Also these fields generate a lot more jobs than arts. Consequently at university more young people pursue science than arts. Another reason for the declining popularity of arts is that people are now busy with their work and career. Tough competition exists in almost all fields and employees have to upgrade their skills constantly. This leaves them with little time to pursue arts. However, this causes more harm than good as humans tend to live a robotic, nonchalant life and finally regret having no time to spend with their families or focus on something they love. There are numerous steps that can be taken in order to combat this personal crisis. To begin with, technology itself can be utilized to promote arts in a more advanced and sophisticated way. Secondly local governments or citizens could organize fun events such as photo gallery, dance competitions, painting exhibitions and so on. People are motivated to go to these events when creative work of their friends or family is showcased. In conclusion, technology is largely responsible for people’s lack of interest in arts; however, in my opinion, the same technology can be used to promote art. This would ensure that there is a clear balance between leisure and work, which can lead to a more productive life. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The governments are always looking for new methods to reduce crime. While some people think that longer prison punishments are the best method, others argue that there are alternative methods which can reduce the crime. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and provide evidence why longer prison sentences are ultimately the better way to reduce crime. There are numerous reasons why longer prison punishments can reduce crime. Firstly, longer and strict prison punishment sends a strong message to the community that crime will not be tolerated. Consequently, many crimes do not happen due to the fear of extended and strict prison punishment. Furthermore, if anyone gets convicted of any crime, he will be sent to from the community so that he cannot commit any crime again. On the other hand, not every criminal has to spend time behind the bar. Petty criminals should be counselled or made to do social service instead of being put in prison. This will give them an opportunity to reform themselves and give back to the society. However, criminals who commit heinous crimes like premeditated murder or rape deserve longer prison terms because they are threat to the society. Also, it is foolish to assume that they can be reformed by making them do community service. To sum up, this essay discussed whether longer prison punishments are better than) alternative methods such as counselling. In my opinion, more extended prison punishment is ultimately the better way to reduce crime because it helps to deter potential offenders as well as prevent convicted criminals from recommitting any crime.

"Thousands of movies are produced every year around the world, however, watching movies is considered as a waste of time among certain demographics of the society. In this essay, I shall discuss why I disagree with the point that watching movies is a total waste of time. Primarily, the extent of movie production has increased very speedily over the course of the last few decades and the money that has been spent to make movies and to watch them, collectively makes up a huge sum. Apparently, for some people time is very precious to be wasted on leisure activities like watching movies which consumes a good amount of both money and time.  On the other hand, leisure activities are considered as a stress buster to overcome the mind fatigue and one such leisure activity is watching movies. The reason behind the huge success of the movie industries in almost every country around the globe is the increase in popularity of movies over the course of time, which infers that a major portion of the population watches movies to get over the stress that they have accumulated over a certain period of time. In addition to that, the wide variety in the categories of the movies makes movie watching notoriously famous. Categories such as documentaries, real life stories of the history of mankind, sports, action and fictional movies attract a major chunk of viewers; the subject is the plural noun categories. It is considered as a method of relaxation to watch a movie after a tiring day/week.  Moreover, educational and culturally diverse movies also bring an opportunity to learn something new every day. During the mid-90’s, it was difficult to watch movies on a regular basis as there were few theatres or homes with television) but with the rise in technology it is neither expensive nor very difficult anymore to enjoy a movie by any means.  In conclusion, the points we discussed infer that movie watching is a notoriously popular activity which is necessary for one to relax and enjoy every now and then.

"While some people think that all the decisions should be made by people in key positions, others think that employees should also be involved in this process. In my opinion, it is better for the company when people in senior positions take important decisions because they have a greater understanding of the business.  Moreover, the primary objective of a business is to generate profits; therefore, catering to employees’ sense of ownership should be considered only as a second priority. People in key positions have access to the information about all the aspects of the company. By contrast, people in junior positions have understanding of only their departments; therefore, they should not be involved in key decisions. This essay fully supports this idea because it is really crucial to consider the impacts of a decision on all the activities of the company. Furthermore, people argue that the speed of decision making increases when fewer people are involved in the process.  On the other hand, several people think that employees should also be involved in the decision making process because it will help them feel that they are part of the management team. They believe that it will increase their sense of ownership and that will eventually lead to a higher level of motivation. I do not agree with this notion because generation of profits is the key objective of almost every company. It is important that steps are taken to increase the motivation level of employees but it should not be the first priority. In conclusion, decisions should be taken by people in key positions because they have access to the information related to all the aspects of the organization. Employees’ involvement is unnecessary because it takes a long time to gather opinions. Moreover, the primary objective of companies is to generate profits and not to involve employees in the decision making process.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Sample essay Globalization, open economy and advancements in communication technologies have had both positive and negative impacts on our lives. The world has become a global village where everyone wears the same kind of outfits, watches the same films, listens to the same music and eats the same food. In my opinion, this trend is more disadvantageous owing to its consequences in the developing world. Thanks to speedier modes of transportation and advancements in communication technologies, ideas, technologies, fashion, trends and products can easily travel between countries. The only country that benefits from this phenomenon is the country where these innovations originate. In most cases, this is a developed nation like the United States. When everyone copies American fashion and buys American products, American companies flourish. For example, Apple products are now a craze all over the world. Since it is an American company when Apple sells more smart phones and tablets, the real beneficiary is the US economy. At the same time, smaller manufacturers in the developing world like India or China are struggling to compete with giants like Apple and Samsung. This creates unemployment in these nations. Another major disadvantage of globalization is that smaller and less developed nations are losing their cultural heritage. Take, for instance, the growing popularity of western outfits in Asia and Africa. People all over the world now use jeans while it is only suitable for use in cold countries. Yet you find men and women wearing jeans in a tropical country like India. This blind copying of fashion and trends cause several health problems for people who adopt them without questioning their suitability. It also kills the ethnic garment industry in their countries. To conclude, when everyone adopts the same trends, the real beneficiaries are the makers of those trends. The rest of the world does not gain anything from this arrangement.

"Social networking sites like Facebook and Instagram have gained tremendous popularity in recent years among the youth. Many people think that these sites have a huge adverse effect on both individuals and community. I completely agree with this argument/view. The intrinsic reason that makes me feel so is that people are getting addicted to these sites. It has been noted that even during office hours, staff members do not hesitate to browse these online sites. Besides this, social media has become a hub for petty crimes. To illustrate, cases of cyber bullying, hacking and stalking are alarmingly high.  Moreover, face-to-face interaction between people has reduced which eventually leads to a polarised society. Thus, children and adults are living isolated lives despite staying in the same home and this brings them closer to psychiatric problems. Concomitantly, these networking sites have deteriorating effect on people’s health. Myriads of health issues like depression, obesity, headache, and poor vision are associated with it. On the other hand, these are some people who found the sites as a remarkable invention in history of innovation. The sites have given a common platform where one can express oneself and communicate to anyone in the world with just one click. The aforementioned discussion boils down to the fact that although social media has given us the freedom to communicate anytime and from anywhere, these networking sites are negatively affecting the lives of many individuals. This pessimistic surge is here to stay if these sites are not used judiciously.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Many health problems are on the rise among working people due to lack of any exercise in their day to day life. There are various reasons for the sedentary lifestyle which can be mitigated by creating awareness and building sufficient infrastructure. There are many factors, which contribute to the lack of exercise in a working adult’s life. Firstly, people have become very lethargic in their day to day life. This could be due to the long commute which consumes much of their energy. Secondly, with the advancement of technology adults are choosing the internet and TV as their source of amusement. Playing, for instance, is no longer considered as a form of entertainment. Thus the popularity of digital forms of entertainment has led to less exercise and more couch time. Finally, the infrastructure available for exercising has not improved much in most parts of the world. Particularly in developing and under developed countries, lack of access to gym facilities has contributed to the inactive lifestyle.  Creating awareness among people about the benefit of exercise will encourage them to include workouts in their daily life. In addition, the government should enforce strict laws that ensure proper work-life balance. Companies that require their employees to work beyond regular working hours should be penalized or made to pay overtime.  Building more public gyms will provide the nudge that most working people need to be more active.  To conclude, the busy lifestyle and lack of access to gym facilities are the main reasons that prevent working people from getting physically active. In order to solve this problem, it is important to create awareness among people about the dangers of a sedentary lifestyle.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is sometimes argued that people nowadays are able to watch films and movies using their mobiles or tablets and there is no reason to go to a cinema; however, others believe that to get the full enjoyment you have to see it in a cinema. In my opinion, watching films and movies at home using my tablet or the laptop is more fun than going to a cinema. On the one hand, some people think that watching films on their mobiles or tablets is better than going to a cinema and I agree with them. In other words watching films on tablets is more comfortable because we can decide how we should sit or what we should wear while watching it. For example, some people prefer to watch films while they relax on their beds. Furthermore, watching on your phone eating what you like is cheaper than going to a cinema and buying drinks and snacks from there. For instance, in order to go to a cinema we have to take a taxi and buy a ticket.  On the other hand, it is often believed that watching films in a cinema give you the full enjoyment because cinemas are fully equipped with high technology machines and sound systems which can make the people more engaged and connected to the movie. Another reason why people like to see movies in the cinema is to avoid the interruption that may occur if they were watching it on their phone or tablet. For example some cinemas put a special equipment to jam the mobile networks so once you entered the hall you cannot receive a call. In conclusion, while people may vary in their opinions, in my opinion, watching films using phones or tablets can be more joyful and interesting than going to the cinemas.

"It is true that humans are responsible for devastating the environment but we can also take steps towards the protection of the environment. In this essay, I will discuss various factors that lead to environmental problems and suggest some measures that the government and individuals can take to address them.  There are numerous factors which are damaging the environment but the two main threats are air pollution and garbage. Hazardous gases are emitted from factories and automobiles running on the roads leading to air pollution. Moreover, excessive consumption of consumer goods leads to the production of more waste. Household and industrial waste not only contaminates the earth but also pollutes the river and ocean. The government can effectively participate to address the issue by introducing various environmental laws and regulations. These laws should be imposed on all kinds of factories and also those industries which lead to air pollution. These types of industries are automobiles and airlines sectors. The government should focus more on ‘green taxes’ than ‘corporate taxes’. In addition, it should invest in public transport facilities so that people will want to use them.  Individual people should also take responsibilities for the impact they have on the environment. They should use public transport more than their private vehicles. Individuals can also take more steps to protect the environment. Firstly, individuals can use those kinds of products/items which have reuse and recycle characteristics. Secondly, they can refuse to take plastic bags if offered by someone while shopping and promote the use of paper or cloth bags. It is important for people to realize that responsible consumption is the way forward. By reusing, recycling and prohibiting plastic, we can help to reduce waste. In conclusion, both the government and individuals should participate to protect the environment and play their respective role in addressing this grave issue. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Technology has become so advanced that it can translate any language. Many people believe that because of technological support, it is no longer necessary to teach children any additional language. In my opinion, I completely disagree with the statement because over-dependence on computers affects our personal growth and also it leads to a communication gap. Communication through technology will lead to lack of understanding among the people. The same word can have different meanings in different contexts. Likewise, different words can have the same meaning. Using a particular word in the right context requires some special skills which computer applications do not possess. For instance, club, band, association and group are all synonyms of society but not all of them can fit in one particular context; therefore there will be some lack of clarity when computers are used to translate. A language is an expression of a culture which only a human being can understand properly. At the same time, over dependence on computers affects our personal growth. When we expose children to the technology to translate a language, then we become over dependent on computers. The result is that we fail to develop our intellectual abilities, which further hinders our ability to solve complex problems. Thus, the cognitive ability to perform a particular task tends to diminish. Furthermore, we will not have access to technology every time and everywhere. For example, in remote places we will not be able to make use of technology due to lack of support; therefore, in those cases, we need to develop our own learning skills in order to communicate with the locals. In conclusion, over dependence on computers will spoil our intellectual development and also such technology can create communication gap among the people. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The extent to which children have to follow rules is in itself a very complex issue, since children across the world grow up in very different cultures. In  for example, children are expected to be very submissive to their parents as well as other adults around them. This, however, is not the case with the Western countries of the world where children follow the motto ‘Thou shalt do what thou wilt’ as promoted by celebrities and rock stars. I believe that following strict rules has both advantages  serious drawbacks as discussed below.Firstly, strict rules of behavior create responsible and respectful children who in turn mature into respectful adults. This forms a stable society which is virtually free from negative trends such as prostitution and drug abuse. Secondly, if children do not follow strict rules of behavior, they may get out of hand and become work-shy and indolent. This may then create a burden on the society since the government has to find ways to cater for these social ills.However, forcing children to follow strict rules of behavior doesn’t always yield positive results as discussed above, most of the time it backfires and works against society. For example, teenagers are more likely to do the opposite of what they’re told to do simply because they want to be independent. Children should also have rights to exercise their free will and develop their own pattern of behaviors. Imposing strict rules may simply destroy the individuality of children.At the end of the day, it is clear that children should be guided by rules, but these rules should not be imposed on them because as human beings, they need to have room to develop their own traits of character and adopt a behavioral pattern of their own.",8,False,85.07974224728152,293

"People believe that the more money they have, the happier they are. Nowadays, many people try their best to accumulate wealth and they believe this is the way to make them happy. In my opinion, there are also some other factors which make people happy.  Money is very powerful and it can help you to solve a lot of problems and bring you a lot of fun. For example, you can choose your job according to your interest and you do not have to worry about income. We will all admit that it is very hard to work on a job that you do not like. If we can choose a job simply based on our own preference, it will definitely make us relaxed and grateful. Moreover, if you are rich enough, you can choose your living environment and spend money on things we enjoy. All of these freedoms make you feel great. On the other hand, money is not the only way to feel joyful / to enjoy happiness. You still can feel a lot of fun even without money. One of the examples is a good relationship with your family and friends. A simple dinner with someone you love or an interesting chit chat with a friend can make you feel joyous / wonderful although these are low cost gatherings. In addition, knowledge is another factor that delights people. You will always feel happy when you learn or do something new.

"Other people feel that it is important to rest the mind during leisure time. Discuss both views and express your opinion.  It is generally accepted that resting in leisure time is good for the physical and mental health whereas some people argue and feel that doing some light activities is more enjoyable in free time. This essay will discuss both sides with logical explanation before arriving at a conclusion. One the one hand, some people enjoy various types of activities in their free time such as surfing the internet, watching movies and playing games. These are probably suitable for those who have physically challenging jobs. For example, people engaging in physically demanding outdoor jobs like nursing or driving may prefer indoor types of activities for relaxation. Thus, it is sensible to understand that some light activities are helpful for those who are working physically. Another point is that some people who are doing sedentary jobs need some outdoor activities. Because after sitting all days in front of their computer it is good for them to do some outdoor activities such as doing exercise and playing games. On the other hand, some people strongly argue that it is better to do nothing and getting complete rest is the best way to enjoy leisure. For instance, lots of my friends do nothing in their free time. This also have some good logic as they prefer to rest completely to refresh themselves. In a nutshell, it is up to the person to decide whether they should rest in their free time or do some light activities; however, I strongly believe that it is better to do some enjoyable activities in the leisure time.

"Nowadays, there is a growing concern among medical practitioners over the excessive use of computer based games by youngsters and toddlers. Playing video games above a certain limit leads to health issues and behavioural changes among young population and there are a number of solutions which could be implemented to deal with it. Firstly, squandering a significant amount of time on playing computer games leads to health issues. This is a problem as it causes young people to have a sedentary lifestyle which leads to diseases such as obesity and cardiac arrest. For instance, in a survey it was reported that 45% of adolescents and kids who invest most of their time in playing video games are more likely to fall prey to obesity. To solve this, awareness must be raised among both parents and children about the ill-effects of playing video games. As a result, parents would deter their offspring from spending overtime on playing computer games and thus reduce their risk of falling ill. Playing a lot of computer games also hurts the mental health of young people. In other words, playing video games especially violent ones makes children more aggressive. This is an issue as it may lead to juvenile offences and could possibly destroy their future. For example, in India it has been observed that the majority of juvenile offenders have the habit of playing a lot of games involving fighting and killing.  To solve this problem, the government should ban / control the circulation of video games containing violence and bloodshed. This move / measure will prevent children’s mind from getting poisoned by violent video content and thus ensure their normal development.  In conclusion, enforcing strict laws and creating awareness among both children and adults about the harmful effects of video games are the effective ways of dealing with this grave concern.

"Recent advancements, in technology and transportation in particular, are reshaping our world in an unprecedented manner. Nowadays, it is not unusual for people to work abroad. Most expatriates relocate their families to the countries . Some people argue that this phenomenon negatively affects children, however, I agree with those who believe the opposite is true.Those who think that relocating children to a new place is undesirable do so for many reasons. Their most common argument is the negative impact of moving on a child’s personality. There is no doubt that living in a different community comes with its challenges, especially to young people, as they get exposed to behaviours, actions and customs they might not be familiar with. As a result, children could possibly feel a lack of stability and some confusion. It is also likely that their patriotic feelings and sense of belonging to their home country could weaken as they would miss many opportunities to celebrate their national events.Nevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion to be ludicrous, as it seems that getting exposed to a new culture is beneficial in many ways. It fosters young  social and emotional capabilities. Moreover, children living abroad have better opportunities to  and practice new languages. Mastering more than one language improves not only their intellectual development, but also their opportunities in acquiring better jobs in the future. According to a recent study published by the University of Chicago, competency in more than one language increases employment chances on average by 200%.In conclusion, I strongly believe that living in a different country positively affects children in all aspects.

"In olden days, people were skilled enough to sew their own outfits and repair household items. However, these skills seem to be vanishing in recent years due to a variety of reasons. This essay illustrates some factors contributing to this change and discusses the present day situation in my country.  There are compelling reasons for the decline of such skills among humans. Nowadays, people spend more time in their work place and they find it difficult to do extra work at home. Also, there are a wide range of commercial shops and service centres available to perform such jobs in a short period of time. Due to the constant evolution of new designs, people are attracted towards such commercial markets and they forget to implement their skills. Moreover, people’s lifestyle has changed and they are earning more, so they value things less. As a result, instead of repairing the old one, people prefer to buy a better one. In my country India, there is a gradual disappearance of these skills; nevertheless, a majority of people still possess these skills. In order to save money, some women sew the clothes of their family members and some men tend to do minor repairs at homes. However, people of this generation prefer to get ready-made or fancy dresses which are readily available in market. Also, they indulge in various other leisure activities like sports and arts and hence they have little or no interest in stitching their clothes or fixing things.   In conclusion, people possessed a lot of skills in the past and now those skills are disappearing.

"Happiness is often perceived as a state of mind. Although for some people having a lot of money is a source of happiness, sometimes happiness depends on certain other things. For example, happiness means good health for the sick and close-knit relations for the deserted.  Money can procure us many valuable items which make our life full of comfort and luxuries and these belongings are often attributed to the happiness in a person’s life. For some having excessive amounts of money brings a sense of satisfaction as it relieves them of their future stresses and also financial worries of their posterity. Besides being able to afford basic amenities, money enables one to indulge in recreational activities that are beyond the reach of commoners and thus bring them a greater feeling of happiness. Concurrently, money evolves into power and with all the power and dominance, it is natural to have a sense of elation. On the other hand, money does not always mean happiness. People often perceive a rich person to be a happy person, but it has been proved illusionary quite a number of times. Under the veil of money, nobody knows how much distressed the owner is. For a person suffering from a long-term ailment, freedom from medication and treatment is definitely an immense source of joy for which they will be ready to spend all of their wealth. Similarly, for someone with no friends or relatives to rely upon in miseries, a shoulder to cry on and a helping hand in need are the means of happiness Therefore happiness cannot always be related to the amount of money one owns. To conclude, while it is a fact that money can buy us luxuries of life in some instances even excess amount of money cannot bring happiness in one’s life and thus due importance should be given to good health and relations in life.

"The Education system has changed over the passage of time. Many people have the opinion that students should be able to criticize / should have the option to criticize their teachers in order to improve the education system. I completely disagree with this opinion because this will spoil the overall education system. I believe that the class strength should be reduced and quality training should be imparted for each student. I believe that criticizing our teachers will disrupt the education system. Criticizing will be like insulting and disrespecting our teachers. This will hurt the student-teacher relationship; as a result, teachers will pay less attention and care for their students. In addition, the emotional bonding between the teachers and the students will become weak. Furthermore, students will not get that mental support and psychological guidance from their teachers. Therefore, it is very important that we give respect to our teachers. In order to improve the education system, we should work on the strength of the classrooms and focus on the individual requirements of the students. If there are so many students in the class, the teacher will not be able to give adequate attention to each of them. For instance, the ideal class strength should be a maximum of twenty students per class but in India, we increase the batch size to over fifty students, in order to increase school revenue. Such systems should be completely abolished, as it impacts the overall performance of the students. Teachers will be able to focus on only a few students at a time; thus by reducing the strength of the class personal attention can be given for each student to better understand their weaknesses, thus such issues can be addressed very well by the teachers.

"In the present age, a number of well-known players are doing different types of product advertisements. In this essay, we will throw some light on the advantages and disadvantages of this trend. Let’s begin by looking into the merits of endorsements by sportspersons. Firstly, players can promote certain products in a better way because they themselves use some of these items in their line of work. Sachin Tendulkar, for example, does the advertisement of an energy drink which he consumes while playing the game. Because of this reason, his endorsement of the product sounds genuine. Secondly, players can make money by doing various types of advertisements. In general, advertisement companies give approximately 25-50 lakhs to the players who work for them. This is a great opportunity for them to convert their popularity and brand value into money. On the other hand, there are some downsides to these celebrity endorsements. Primarily, this could take away the players’ focus from the game. To elucidate, last year, Virat Kohli, a renowned Indian cricketer, was not able to perform as expected in Asian Cup. Some people assert that this happened because he was featured in myriads of advertisements at that time which took his concentration away from the match. Furthermore, athletes could become money minded if they do a lot of advertisement campaigns. The result of this could be devastating for the players and ruin their game play. What’s more, sometimes players endorse poor quality products just because they are offered truckloads of money. In my opinion, this is a misuse of the trust their admirers have placed in them.  In conclusion, there is no doubt that popular players are advertising several products and this phenomenon has some obvious drawbacks and benefits which are given in the above paragraphs.

"Plants and animals have already suffered a great deal of damage due to human activities. Some people think that nothing can be done to undo the damage we have already caused to the planet. However, I am still hopeful. Since human population is increasing year after year, there is a need for more and more resources. Also, people are living longer. More space is now needed to accommodate them and to grow food for them. Hence, trees are cut down to build houses and to make furniture. Forests are cleared for growing crops and these activities lead to the loss of habitat for birds and animals. Many species of birds and animals have already become extinct. Even so, I am hopeful that it is never too late to do something about this. Actually, environmentalists all over the world have already started working together to mitigate this problem. They have begun to spread awareness among public. They have made people realize that deforestation not only leads to the loss of flora and fauna but causes climate change by increasing the amount of greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere. People have sort of realized that humans cannot exist when other forms of life go extinct. Many countries have already passed laws that ban the killing of animals for their body parts or for fun. For example, about a decade ago, humpback whales became almost extinct due to overfishing but after environmental enthusiasts launched vigorous conservation programmes their number has bounced back. Thus it is evident that with active participation of everybody concerned we can solve this pressing issue in a short period of time.

"Many people opine that public modes of transport should be free of cost in urban cities. This notion has both advantages and disadvantages.  Global warming is on the rise at an alarming rate. This is the effect of emissions, traffic fumes, and waste from automobile industries. Firstly, free public transportation will barely have a detrimental effect on the environment. Fewer private vehicles means less pollution, which further leads to a safe and healthy environment. Secondly, it will aid people to save money, as they do not have to spend a single penny for transportation. In other words, free modes of transport are advantageous not only for the environment but also for human beings Whilst there are advantages to this notion, there are a few drawbacks to consider. One of the major disadvantages is the cost. In order to provide free public transport, the government will have to earmark a huge amount of money. This can put a strain on the public exchequer. Also, since the service does not generate any revenue the government will eventually lose the motivation to spend on its maintenance. Consequently, free public transport may fail to provide a comfortable and safe journey. Over time, poor maintenance may discourage people from using the service.  In conclusion, free public transport in urban areas is a definitely a great idea to reduce air pollution and traffic congestion. However, this is not a viable idea because maintaining a service that does not generate any revenue will be difficult for the government in the long run.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

Other people believe that only through an increasing population can the world’s economy and society develop.This population increase is not constant around the world; population is undergoing significant growth especially in less developed countries, and the continent of Africa is predicted to undergo the highest increase. Many people living in these less developed countries frequently face shortages, such as water, food, heating, cooking fuel and medicines, and people have to live in substandard living conditions by western standards. With more inhabitants, these difficulties will become exacerbated and helping these countries might also create strain on the resources and economies of other countries.On the other hand, many countries are unable to reach their economic potential due to a lack of skilled work forces. For these countries a growing population can mean a stronger economy and, due to that, a better standard of living. Growing populations can also lead to growing demand for goods, allowing economies to expand. The problem is, however, that countries that are in need of labour forces and increasing demand are already the more developed countries and they meet some of these needs by immigration and exporting goods.In conclusion, while certain areas of the world are in need of larger work forces to develop their economies, the continuously increasing population could potentially lead to crisis within countries that already struggle to provide for their inhabitants.",9,False,54.49819494584837,255

Tourists spend a large amount of money on food, goods, transport, souvenirs, tours and entry fees to the matches. For example, Brazil received more than 5 millions of tourists during the last World Cup. Their efforts paid off well because the revenue from the event was much higher than the amount they spent on it. In addition, when a country hosts a huge international tournament, it will gain a lot of global recognition. The host nation receives a lot of media attention before, during and after the games. Television channels, radio stations, newspapers and social media offer up to the moment information on the games and the host country. To illustrate, my Korean classmate had not known that Brazil is located in South America until he saw the inauguration of the World Cup 2014. In conclusion, although governments invest large amounts of funds to host an international sports competition, in my opinion the benefits outweigh the drawbacks. These events attract more tourists to the country and improve their economy.",7,False,102.24551569506727,258
"Some people think that in order to be a successful sportsperson or entertainer, a person needs some natural talent. Others oppose this view and argue that anyone can master the techniques with some practice and become successful. In my opinion, some amount of talent is certainly needed. To begin with, a big chunk of general population thinks that talent is something sports stars or singers already possess from the very young age. Many of the famous celebrities grew up in a family full of music or sports icons, due to which they already have genes to be good at what their family members are. Therefore, it has been agreed that these people are naturally born stars. A good example of this is the 4 times NBA champion Steph Curry, whose father was a professional basketball player who played for 20+ years. However, many argue that children can be coached to become better in any field they wish to be. Some parents enrol their off-springs to get trained by famous people, but this will not be successful if the child does not want to learn that particular skill. Hence, I disagree with the argument that talent can be instilled into pupils to make them better at something. For instance, research has shown that the majority of the people who go to acting school do not make it big despite the fact that they learned it. In conclusion, even though skills can be taught to kids, in my opinion there are some children who are born with these skills and excel in the respective fields without any formal training.

"Today, technological innovations like robots have become an integral part of our lives. We use them to perform a variety of tasks both at home and work. In my opinion, this is a positive development and there are several social and economic reasons behind this. First, our lifestyle has changed dramatically over the years. We have become super busy. We have demanding careers and a happening social life. We want to achieve as much as we can both on the professional front and in the personal space. Obviously, this requires time. Since we all have only twenty-four hours in a day, the need for time saving gadgets increases. Robots meet this demand perfectly. They can perform many mundane tasks faster and more efficiently than us. They can cook, clean and wash. Some robots can even babysit. Needless to say, they are invading our homes and offices and that is quite understandable. Take, for instance, the case of the cleaning robot ROMBA. More and more Americans are using it today it allows them to save a great deal of time which they can use to perform more rewarding tasks like studying, working or socializing. The growing popularity of robots is generally a positive trend. Robots do not get tired or bored. They will happily perform the same task for hours on end. And unlike humans, they are less likely to make mistakes. While safety can still be an issue, the technology is developing fast and we will soon have a solution to safety concerns as well. To conclude, the growing popularity of robots can be attributed to the fact that they allow us to save a lot of time. In my opinion, this is a positive trend that needs to be encouraged.  ",9,False,85.29113138459628,291
"It has been observed that people are getting less sleep in most of the countries. Busy lifestyle and career opportunities are a few factors responsible for this. Owing to such a lifestyle, a plethora of negative impacts have been observed on individuals and the society. Firstly, people are taking less rest due to their hectic lifestyle. In most of the places, people travel long distances to work. Most of their time is consumed in travelling and due to incessant increase in traffic every single day, it gets difficult for an individual to reach home on time. Secondly, people devote extra time to their office for their career growth and to get promotions. These expectations encourage them to take more work and create a competitive environment. As a result, they do not get enough time for themselves to relax. Moreover, monetary benefits are one of the preponderant factors. Many workers increase their working hours to get paid more so that they can afford the things which would otherwise be unable for them to afford. For instance, there are myriad of jobs which are based on incentives. The more business an employee brings for his company, the more incentives he gets. Owing to such benefits, people start working till late hours and take less rest. However, working late hours and not getting adequate sleep will have detrimental effects on an individual’s health. People who have office jobs and who work late hours on computers are affected with vision problems, and it has also been found that most of such professionals are diagnosed with adiposity. Another major effect which has been noticed due to inadequate sleep is the behavioural issues in an individual. People get short-tempered and there have been many instances where people found themselves in confrontation with others over minor issues. In conclusion, due to many factors such as the longing for professional growth and to receive higher wages, people are taking less rest in most of the countries. Consequently, they develop many health problems which have a negative impact on their performance and general disposition. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Nowadays women are excelling in every field. While a part of the society argues that they should get similar opportunities in national defence department, I would agree with those who argue that their physical frailty and tenderness does not make them fit for the jobs in this domain.  Admittedly, gender equality should exist in every field including the armed forces. Females have equal rights and if they feel determined enough to excel in defence they should enroll themselves. For example, ex-commissioner Kiran Bedi is an eminent personality known for her determination, selflessness, and passion for serving the police department.  On the other hand, physically women are not as strong as men and hence women should choose jobs that are not physically demanding. For example, other than being part of the force, women should consider joining related departments like cyber crime or intelligence bureau where they can make best use of their intelligence and leadership skills. The hurdles and challenges that are faced by military forces are too brutal most of the times. The action plans and missions require a lot of physical stamina and women mostly lack this brute strength. They do not possess enough endurance to fight the enemies and are naturally soft-hearted. Furthermore, a job in armed forces requires round the clock commitment which is mostly challenging for women. In conclusion, although we should promote egalitarianism and respect women’s rights to excel even in army, I believe that they are extremely tender to face challenges involved in this domain and can lose their self-respect.

"In certain countries people are facing too many health issues due to excessive consumption of fast food. Some people are of the view that to bring this in control the government ought to increase the tax on such food items. However, I completely disagree with this view as I feel that imparting health related knowledge to the citizens and banning hazardous food items are the best ways to deal with this problem.  Undoubtedly, consuming too much fast food leads to many health related concerns. To tackle this, the government has to step in and impart education to the citizens regarding the amount of fast food they can eat and its ill effects rather than imposing higher tax as it will increase the burden on middle class people. To illustrate, in most of the countries about 65% of the population consists of middle class and if the state imposes higher taxes on any food item they will be the most affected lot. Therefore educating people of all class about the health issues arising out of junk food consumption is more feasible.  Fast food contains certain ingredients which are extremely harmful to the human body. Such ingredients should be banned by the government to deal with the health problems arising out of its consumption.  This step can eradicate the problem from its root cause. For example, Ajinomoto is one such ingredient which is extensively used in fast food preparations. Health specialists consider it as the slow poison to the human body and it also causes cancer. This kind of food substances used in fast food should be put on the banned list. This measure will be more successful than increasing the tax on fast food. In conclusion, I firmly believe that imposing tax will not help much in solving the health issues arising out of excessive consumption of fast food as it will not address the root cause of the issue; rather it would put more economic pressure on poor and middle class sections of the society.

"There has been a dramatic change in the lifestyle of people over the years and they have become busier. The availability of readymade food has made it easy to maintain this modern lifestyle. While there are some clear benefits to this situation, I personally believe that the drawbacks are more significant. The main advantage of the convenience food is that it saves the time which is spent in cooking food. As a result, people can utilize this time for other purposes such as relaxing and doing other recreational activities. Moreover, the productivity of work has increased. For instance, there are many food stalls available at the workplace; thus one finds it convenient to have lunch with so many options to choose. Also, one does not have to wake up early to cook food. On the other hand, there are many disadvantages associated with readymade food. For example, it may be unhealthy and unhygienic. Firstly, it does not provide complete nutrition and contains preservatives which are harmful if consumed in excess quantity. For example, studies have linked the rise in cancer cases to the high content of preservatives in the packed food. In addition, the standards of hygiene are not maintained in many food stalls. This can lead to the spreading of diseases such as typhoid and cholera and reduce the productivity of people. To conclude, time saving is the main advantage of the availability of convenience food; however, in my opinion, the disadvantages of regular consumption of readymade food outweigh the advantages. Given this, it is recommended that people should give up their dependence on packaged food and consume more homemade food.",7,False,62.76722298908269,272
"The internet has revolutionized the life of the modern man. These days, adolescents are mostly seen using the online service excessively and it is believed that it is negatively affecting their social skills. In my opinion, this belief is true but this problem can be resolved if teenagers are guided properly by their parents and educators. There are myriads of reasons why usage of the internet is detrimental for children. Firstly, most of their time is being spent sitting on computer either doing some assignment or surfing the social networking sites which certainly isolates them from their family members. Secondly, their involvement in social events is minimal / negligible owing to their interest in making online foreign friends; thus, they remain inactive in their local surroundings. Thirdly, they usually lack in the communication skills as they persistently live in their virtual world. However, the negative influence of the internet can be reduced if elders constantly monitor the activities of their children and advise them about the demerits of being online for long hours. Parents should devote time to their adolescence child; subsequently, it is better to form a timetable for their children and make sure that they adhere to the healthy lifestyle. Moreover, parents can even participate in leisurely activities along with their children to motivate them to remain socially active. In conclusion, although the internet has generally had a positive impact on all spheres of life, it can be harmful for young people because they are using it to an extreme degree which prevents from being active in their local community. However, parents and teachers can improve the situation to a great extent by teaching youngsters about the downside of spending too much time online. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.",8,False,90.3960979687194,338
"Online courses have become more popular over the years and many people opine that they are better than traditional classroom courses. While attending a class can improve a student’s concentration levels, courses on the internet can be more comfortable and flexible. I believe that education online is far more beneficial than the traditional classroom approach. Regular classroom courses certainly have some benefits. There are fewer distractions in a classroom and there is a teacher who is present before him and he will make sure that the student’s attention is not diverted. Moreover, most of the time the facial expressions of students can help educators understand whether the class is interesting or not. For example, research showed that graduates in India still prefer going to coaching centers to learn new computer languages and other courses due to the fact that they can interact with tutors live and have undivided attention during the session. Yet, traditional courses are expensive. Also, they require the student to physically attend the class at a particular time and place.  On the other hand, online education can have several advantages. Firstly, students can attend any session from their home. So they don’t have to waste their time and energy travelling from home to college. Besides, home is a stress-free environment, so it helps them to understand the concepts better and they can ask questions confidently because there is no one around to make them feel shy. Secondly, online courses give access to a wide range of best tutors around the world. If a student is from a different region and would like to learn a course that is offered in another part of the globe, he can opt for an online course and learn about it. For instance, Germany is known for its automobile industry and most of the experts are from the same place, so if a person wants to learn about it and cannot afford to go there, then Skype sessions can be of great help.  To conclude, although regular classroom courses can have an emotional touch, online learning can be free of stress and enable students to learn different global courses right from the place they live. Hence, I agree with the argument that online programmes are better.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate. Want to improve your grammar?

"How to write an essay on this topic? Watch this video lesson here. These days the majority of young people are spending their leisure time in shopping. Growing consumerism and ease of shopping are the main reasons for this. However, in my opinion, this is a negative development that cannot be encouraged. Exposure to social media and new age advertising are the main reasons that encourage people to go on a shopping spree whenever they have time. Search engines and social websites track people’s online behaviour and show them targeted advertising. As a result, people are lured into buying even those things they do not need. The influence of celebrities is another reason that encourages people to pick up this habit. Thanks to the advancement and easily accessible technology, anyone can be a celebrity online and can endorse anything. Unfortunately, shopping addiction cannot be encouraged. I firmly believe that they should pursue a fruitful activity like exercising rather than going on a shopping spree whenever they get some free time. Youngsters are full of energy and have so much potential. They should rather focus on their career or devote some time to the society or maybe even volunteer for a noble cause. By engaging in such activities they can improve their career prospects and make the world a better place to in. Shopping addiction, on the other hand, not only costs them their time but it may also leave a hole in their wallets.

"Air and water pollution caused by industrial and construction activities have become a major concern in many countries around the world. Although this is a serious issue, several measures can be taken to mitigate it.  Firstly, governments can bring in regulations to curb industrial and construction activity near water bodies. Industries working near water bodies emit toxic solid and liquid by-products to nearby water bodies and thus pollute them. For example, there has been improvement in the water quality of an Indian state after the state government imposed a rule that restricted / banned industries within 5km radius of rivers. Similarly, construction near water bodies also pollutes water. Therefore, the government’s resolve to impose such regulations certainly helps to mitigate the issue. Several measures can be taken to improve the air quality as well. Decrease in air quality caused by the construction sites can be improved to a great extent by building different modules at the factories themselves. Therefore, only assembling of different such modules is required at the construction site which will surely reduce air pollution. Finding innovative methods of production that do not emit a lot of poisonous gases is another way to enhance air quality. Thus with the help of these above mentioned measures, we can reduce the air pollution issue to a great extent. In conclusion, there is no denying the fact that construction and industrial activities cause air and water pollution. However, by enforcing stringent laws that ban industries near water bodies and urban areas and by adopting eco-friendly construction methods, this problem can be solved to a great extent.

"It is an irrefutable fact that shopping online has become increasingly popular these days. In this regard, there is a possibility that online shopping would lead to the closure of brick and mortar stores in cities and towns in the future. This essay will discuss the possibility of this happening. To begin with, the vital reason for the closure of physical stores in future is that consumers are quite satisfied with the unique shopping experience provided by online sites. This is because they have wide varieties of shopping options to choose from coupled with fast and reliable delivery channels which makes most of the customers prefer e-commerce sites over traditional stores. For instance, recently, in Bengaluru many renowned stores had to shut down because of the change in shopping preferences of customers. Consequently, given the fact that e-commerce companies have entered into almost every sector, there is a high possibility that retail stores will eventually perish. Another compelling reason that the e-commerce giants will succeed over retail shops is that they have larger capital base and lower overhead cost. These companies have enormous net worth to afford substantial marketing cost to penetrate the market despite the competition from the stores. For example, Amazon has launched plethora of drones for initiating faster delivery which would decrease the manpower cost dramatically. As a result, although these companies incur huge capital expenditure, the income generated over a period of time is multifold which makes them market leaders and thus lead to the elimination of the traditional stores. In conclusion, it can be anticipated that e-commerce companies will acquire the entire market share in the future because they provide exceptional client service and are efficiently able to reduce the overhead expenditure.

"Some people believe that students of different ages should be taught in the same class. I certainly disagree with this idea as the learning capacity of students varies with age.  Older children have higher cognitive skills which make it possible for them to grasp advanced concepts relatively easily. For example, a ten year old can grasp things more easily than a five year old and hence if they are taught together neither will benefit. If the lessons are tweaked to suit the learning capacity of the younger students, the older students will gain nothing from attending the class. By contrast, if the lessons are designed for the seniors in the class, the juniors will not understand anything. In short, neither will benefit from this arrangement. Another disadvantage of teaching students of different ages in the same class is that it will unnecessarily expose the juniors in the class to the bad habits of seniors. For example a survey in the UK revealed that 80% of young students are bullied by seniors and are forced to try drugs in schools. This peer pressure can push a child into various illegal activities which they will not commit if they are studying with students of their age. To sum up, putting students of different ages in the same class is not a good idea, as it can affect a child’s learning skills and may also expose them to things that are not appropriate for their age. Hence, it is recommended that schools consider the age while enrolling students into different classes.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In this day and age, travelling around the world has become quite common because of better connectivity and cheaper flights. Some people believe that international tourism should be promoted because of its positive impacts. I totally agree with this view because tourism industry can be beneficial for a country and its people. First and foremost, the tourism industry can create a variety of job opportunities for the natives. As international tourism benefits travel agencies, transportation services and accommodation providers, there will be a huge demand for local employees in the job market. In the long term, promoting tourism can be an effective way for the local government to solve the unemployment problem. In addition to creating job opportunities, international tourism benefits the local economy in several other ways. Generally speaking, travelers from different countries are willing to spend money during their international trip. For example, it is common for Chinese tourists to spend a large amount of money on meals and luxury brands during their foreign trips. This can be a significant source of income for local stores, brands and restaurants. Moreover, there is no denying the fact that tourists love visiting heritage sites. By maintaining these sites properly, the government can showcase the rich culture and heritage of their country in front of an international audience. Better still, tourism is a green industry. It does not pollute the air or the soil.",8,False,73.74810964083176,233
"Parents have always been concerned about their children’s education. Some people believe that home schooling is the best option, while others prefer regular schools. I personally believe that both systems have their own advantages but if I had to choose one I would pick the latter one. To begin with, teaching children at home is more efficient in terms of academic performance. Pupils who are taught by their parents benefit from having one to one lessons. Instructors can pay more attention to them and therefore they boost the learning process. A research done / conducted by the US department of Education proved that kids who receive home education develop their linguistic and numerical skills earlier than their formal school counterparts. As a result, it is undeniable that children learn faster at home. On the other hand, kids at schools not only learn academic subjects but also figure out how to socialize and cooperate with other students. Children at schools learn several social skills that will prepare them for their adulthood. For instance, they might learn how to stand up against a bully or how to work on teams. As a result, school students learn a wide range of social and academic skills that will be crucial for their future development.  To conclude, in my opinion home schooling might seem more practical but by taking this path, parents are denying their sons and daughters the opportunity to achieve key interpersonal abilities. In the future, some home schooling supporters would realize this drawback and try to develop a mixed method where students study at home some days and attend school the rest of the week.

"A significant increase has been witnessed in the amount of waste that we are producing these days. This essay will discuss how the recent surge in industrial activities has triggered this issue and how the introduction of strict regulations by governments can play an important role in reducing the amount of waste. During the last few decades, industrial activities have increased and this has resulted in the production of higher amounts of waste. Manufacturing units and factories are operating day and night to produce goods required by industries, and at the same time they are polluting our environment with dangerous chemicals and waste materials resulting from the production activities. For instance, China faced / encountered the highest level of air pollution during the last three decades and it is exactly the same period during which the country witnessed a whopping increase in its export of locally manufactured goods.  To reduce the waste, strict regulations should be imposed by governments so that companies are encouraged to improve their waste management systems. If companies are penalized for the amount of waste produced, they will find ways to reduce their negative impact on the environment. Levying tax on polluting industries is a step in the right direction. For example, many European countries have imposed taxes on the carbon dioxide emissions and this has helped to keep the emission level in these countries at a very low level. In conclusion, increased industrial activities are to be blamed for the higher amount of waste produced. However, governments can tackle the issue by introducing taxes and penalties on the waste material produced by manufacturing companies.

"Work places are now being made more and more employee friendly with lavish recreational areas and flexible work hours. Women do play an important role in offices and their importance is increasing by the day. Some people opine that this may cause imbalance to their family lives, but I do not agree to this fact. With the rise in activists that vouch for gender equality and the laws that support it, most institutions hire more women to fill in job positions. This not only breaks the glass ceiling that used to haunt successful women, but also gives them huge self-confidence to explore new opportunities and live out their dreams. Different industries are trying to create formidable working environments for the employees, to improve their sense of belonging to their work place. This in turn makes employees more dedicated to their work and produce better business outcomes. For example, the information technology industry has made it easier for employees to work by introducing facilities to work from home, hence improving their work life balance. This ensures that work life does not get in the way of their family lives. Some disparagers opine that work life disrupts family life for women as they grow up the ladder in their work places. They argue that women are solely responsible to take care of their family. But, that need not be true when both the female along with the male counterpart, adjusts and acts responsibly to take care of their family. Both partners can take various roles within the family to manage daily chores and responsibilities that come along with children. In conclusion, contrary to some detractors, I do not agree to the statement that women’s family life get disturbed as they grow up the ladder in workplace. With the correct mindset and the opportunities organisations provide, women just as their male counterpart, can manage their family lives even when their dependency in workplace increases.

"People have different views on how new houses should be built. While some argue that new homes in a locality should be built to match the traditional building style of that area, others insist that house owners should be allowed to choose whatever design they like. In my opinion, the occupants of a house should have the freedom to decide how it should look. There are definitely a few benefits to following the traditional style. It lends a classic look to the neighbourhood. Also, when all houses look the same, residents feel a sense of equality. People often build palatial homes to show off their wealth. By simply asking them to build a home that matches other homes in the locality the government can stop this audacious display of wealth. On the flip side, there are many more benefits to building a home as per the needs and wants of its owner. To start with, homes that look alike lack character. A home is a reflection of the owner’s personality. It is  a space you own and for this reason, the local authorities should allow people to decide how their homes should be built. Also, traditional buildings are not very energy efficient or comfortable. Many of them also lack modern features such as attached bathrooms or modular kitchens. In addition, adding features such as CCTV cameras or burglar alarms to a traditionally built home can be a challenge. To conclude, while it is easy to follow the historical style of building homes, in my opinion, it is important to allow people to decide how their homes should be built because a home is much more than a place to live in. It is an extension of your personality.",9,False,60.85263157894737,288
"Encouraging children to do part time job during their leisure time is becoming nowadays. Even though it helps to develop the habit of hardworking and confidence in children, it has some drawbacks as well. Firstly, part time jobs will help the children to understand and experience the      difficulties and hardships parents face during their everyday day life to raise them.      This will surely enable them to appreciate the hard work of their parents and children will try to          share some of the responsibilities. They will understand the need for sharing and      caring. Working in a team will help children understand the             importance of interdependence and accepting the peers. A part time job also gives them a taste of their future life and will help them to organise their life in a disciplined manner and  teach them how to balance personal life and work On the other hand, non availability of free time will affect the mental and physical            development of children. They will be forced to go to work after school hours and the         valuable time they get to play and remould their fine motor skills will be reduced. The  chance to earn money at a young age will also result in social and moral issues among          children. Since they don’t know how to manage the financial matters, they will utilize it for anti social activities such as smoking, alcohol consumption. The part time job will      also reduce their opportunities to interact with their peers of same age. In conclusion, even though a part time job is beneficial for nurturing in children qualities like             interdependence, self confidence and courage to face real life situations, it may affect the mental and physical development of children.

"It is argued that in some nations, the governing bodies / authorities give priority to economic growth as compared to the other concerns. While the main advantage of this approach is better living standards, I believe that it can affect health and education of the general public.  The primary advantage of prioritizing economic growth is that it can improve living standards and reduce the poverty rate. In other words, high average incomes enable consumers to enjoy more goods and services and a better lifestyle. This means that people will have more income that will eventually reduce the poverty rate. For example, a recent report published by BBC suggested that economic growth in the twentieth century was a major factor in reducing absolute levels of poverty and enabling a rise in life expectancy.  However, economic growth alone will not suffice. Health and education are equally important. The major drawback of prioritizing economic growth is that it can have a negative impact on the environment. China, for example, is growing rapidly. Unfortunately, this is at the expense of the environment. The air quality is China is perhaps the lowest in the world. Fast growing Indian cities are no different. While economic growth is good, the resultant pollution can affect the health of the people. It can also destroy wildlife. Another issue is that when nations try too hard to grow financially, culture and morality may take a hit.  In conclusion, although prioritizing economic growth is beneficial because it increases the living standards and reduces the poverty rate, I believe that it has a negative impact on the environment and health of people.

"According to some people, the government should not spend money on space exploration. I agree with this view. In my opinion, there are other areas that need public spending. Also, space exploration is not crucial for the development of a country. Of course, there are some benefits to investing in space research. It helps us to learn more about the universe we are a part of. Also, there is a possibility that some space missions may find life on other planets. We may also be able to find other inhabitable planets. Since, population growth is leading to a resource crunch on planet earth, finding another planet that can sustain life is in the larger interest of the whole humanity. On the other hand, there is no guarantee that we will find another planet that we can colonize. It is a mere possibility and it may take hundreds or thousands of years before we actually manage to achieve it. Hence, spending public money on such projects is unlikely to offer much in return at the moment. What’s more, there are several other pressing needs on earth that need immediate resolution. For example, millions of people still do not have access to potable water or education. Even today, thousands of people die in war and conflicts almost every day. It is foolish to spend money on space programmes before addressing these issues. Actually, making our planet more livable is much better than finding another planet to live in. In conclusion, although outer space exploration projects help us to learn more about the universe, these projects are not crucial for the development of a country. Moreover, public money should be spent on more pressing issues like healthcare and education because they directly impact the public. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Write at least 25o words Museums and monuments showcase the history ,culture and tradition of any country. Most of such places , nowadays , attract tourists while the footfall of local inhabitants is meager. There are numerous reasons for such a trend and simple measures taken by the government can increase the attendance of local people . To begin with , local people shun museums and historical sites because the experience to visiting such places is often monotonous. Most of the monuments are standing for centuries and museums are usually not regularly updated. Therefore, although they are always in tourist’s itinerary on account of new experience but for natives regular visits is quite often boring. Another reason for infrequent visits by the locals is the cost. Most of the museums and historical places have entry fees which is often an issue in developing countries where majority earn just enough money to make the ends meet. Finally, most governments are busy focusing on science and technology which will bring bright future but this is being done at the cost of neglecting our glorious past. Due to this biased behavior by the authorities, people are loosing interest in museums and archaeological sites. There are multiple simple solutions which can be taken by government to rekindle the interest. One way could be organizing regular events like exhibitions, inter – cultural events and light shows which can provide natives a varied experience every time they visit the site. Another step could be scrapping the entry fees so that everyone can visit them. Finally , the local authorities should aggressively advertise museums and monuments so that it engross the locals.  ",7,False,92.02190222914099,277
"It is often debated how much freedom children should have. Although some people believe that the activities of children should be monitored closely by parents, others oppose this viewpoint. I, however, believe that parental supervision is only necessary until they are mature. Children should be monitored until they reach a certain age because they are unaware of the world outside the secure environment of the home and they are not mature enough to understand the difference between good and bad. Consequently, they can fall an easy prey to a bad company of friends, if not guided by parents. Furthermore, the internet has a lot to offer apart from knowledge and information. To exemplify, one of my friend’s daughter misused social media websites to send obscene / vulgar messages to her male friends to draw their attention. These types of instances can be avoided if children use the internet under the surveillance of their parents. On the other hand, there are some valid reasons to give children the freedom to make their choices. Firstly, after they reach a certain level of maturity, children should be encouraged to make their own decision. This practice will help them learn faster than those who are dependent on their parents for making decisions for them. Actually, learning from one’s own mistakes is easier than learning from knowledge imparted by one’s parents.  In conclusion, I believe that until a certain age, children need parental guidance; however, once they are mature, they should be allowed to make their own decisions because this practice will help them to achieve greater success than when they are dependent on their parents.

"It is universal among humans to have the desire to possess expensive items. Some people who do not have any restraint when it comes to shopping often face serious economic / financial consequences. Such behaviour can be due to advertising propaganda and it can be prevented by proper counselling. With the advancement in mass media technology, information about many products continues to reach the customers. After repeatedly watching a particular advertisement, people tend to purchase them even if they cannot afford them or do  not have any immediate requirement. This became more rampant with the advent of online platforms for shopping, where many things can be bought even from the home. False pride is another factor that drives the compulsive urge to buy.  Those who compare their possessions with those of their wealthy neighbour tend to make unnecessary purchases. On the other hand self contained individuals utilizes their money judicuiously. As utilizing money for such activities can have devastating results on the entire family, effective measures are to be taken to prevent it. One such thing is having a reasonable budget plan. The source of income and expenditure should be caluculated on a timely basis. Expensive things should only be bought with the savings.  Without such a plan, the management of money can be difficult. Sometimes excessive spending can be due to psychological abnormality and requires counselling from the experts. The root cause of such behaviour can be identified and cured with proper treatment. To conclude, the easy accessibility to various products coupled with greed can lead to thoughtless spending. This behaviour can be kept in check through proper financial planning.

"Many people are living alone these days. There are several reasons behind this trend and the most important among them are the need to acquire higher education and independence. In my opinion, living alone has more benefits than disadvantages. Students often have to live alone. Prestigious universities are situated in metropolitan cities and hence students who want to study in these universities have to relocate to cities and live away from their parents. An advantage of this arrangement is that they will learn to cook, clean and manage their finances. And such skills are crucial for success in life. Professionals are also migrating to big cities in search of better job prospects. They also live away from their family. Some people choose to live alone because they cannot manage the monthly expenses if they live with their family. For example, many people who work in foreign countries do not take their family with them because of their inability to provide for them. They live alone and send their savings to their family living in their native place.  On the down side, there are some downsides to living alone. When people live alone it affects their relationship with their family members because of the lack of face to face interactions with them. What’s more, young people who live alone are more likely to get into bad company and develop harmful habits.  To conclude, even though living alone has become a popular trend and has its inherent advantages, people have to pay attention to its demerits in order to sustain family bonds. They also need to ensure that they are keeping good company.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate. ",7,False,45.45810336176618,291
"Nowadays many students pursue their higher studies in foreign countries. The main advantage for students studying abroad is the access to better quality education and improved job prospects. Although these can be beneficial there are some disadvantages like difficulty to adapt to the local culture and linguistic challenges. In my opinion, despite these downsides, students studying abroad enjoy better career prospects and exposure to diverse cultures.  The main advantage is that the students will get global exposure and quality of education will be high and so will be the the career growth and wages. Whenever students visit foreign countries they will experience different set of new things like culture, language, and climate etc. For example, Sundar Pichai CEO of Google comes from India and he did his higher education in USA and got himself into a position that fulfilled his career ambition. I strongly support that there are lots of advantages to pursuing education abroad.  On the down side, studying abroad poses many challenges. An international student may have to deal with racism. They may also find it difficult to adapt to the alien culture and climate. For example, Indian students studying in cold countries like Canada and the UK often complain of the harsh winters they have to cope with. For example, one of my friends applied for his post-graduation degree abroad and he spent lots of money to get into that university, but unfortunately he was not able to adapt to their syllabus and climate so returned to his home country midway through the first semester. Such incidents are not rare. In conclusion, the fact that more and more students opt to study abroad is a clear indication that the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages. Of course, there are some minor drawbacks to pursuing higher education abroad, but a student who is willing to adapt to the cultural and climatic change can reap rich benefits from studying overseas.

"According to some people, only those who have demanding hobbies can have fun. I totally disagree with this view. In my opinion, a hobby whether it is relaxing or challenging can be pleasurable and people usually choose their hobby based on their personal situations and interest. To begin with, some people find it more enjoyable when they spend their leisure time doing activities that are more relaxed, rather than complicated. This is because they might be working in a stressful environment. For them, a hobby is a way to relax their body and mind and feel energised for their work the next day. If, instead, they pick up a challenging hobby, it will require a lot of their efforts and time and they might find it hard to cope with their daily routine. In many cases they may just give up on their hobby. On the other hand, some people only have fun when they do activities that are demanding. The reason for this is that they want to push their limits and learn new things during their free time. The hobby, as per them, is a way to enhance their knowledge and develop skills. For example, photography is a favourite pastime of many people. Although learning to click and edit pictures is a demanding and time-consuming activity, many people still enjoy this hobby. It is because of the satisfaction they get when they are able to successfully learn it. Personally, I feel that people should choose a hobby based on their liking and other personal circumstances and not on the basis of its difficulty level. Whether the hobby is challenging or relaxing does not matter as long as people are able to have fun taking part in it.  To conclude, while some people enjoy relaxing hobbies because of their hectic work schedule, others find arduous hobbies more interesting and fun as it enables them to push their boundaries. In my opinion, both types of hobbies can be enjoyable and people should choose one based on their interest and personal conditions. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"E-learning is gaining popularity. It is thought by many that e-books will eventually replace paperback books while others do not agree with this view. This essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of this development in detail. E-books are portable and lightweight and hence they are easy to carry around. Instead of carrying multiple bulky books, one e-book reader can carry thousands of e-books. Thus, they save lot of space in your home and office. Moreover, these are easily accessible anywhere. One can download and store them for later use. Students and employees can access learning material while travelling or even when they are at home. Better still, trees are not cut down to produce ebooks. Needless to say, their popularity is soaring. According to a survey conducted by Amazon, there is a 40% increase in the sale of ebooks over the last few years.  However, there are some drawbacks associated with this development. Firstly, it requires a special device or computer to store and read e-books. Unlike traditional books, electronic books require an e-reader and a special charger to keep that device running. Poor people may not be able to afford them. Secondly, staring at a screen for long hours can cause eye strain. However, technology is developing and now many ebook readers have an electronic paper display that does not hurt the eyes.   To conclude, the rising popularity of ebooks is certainly a positive trend because ebooks are environment friendly and convenient. They do have some downsides but they are likely to be addressed as technology develops.  ",8,False,98.87775699674805,258
"As the world is becoming more and more competitive, many individuals are working long hours to survive, which in turn is leaving them with very less time for their leisure activities. This essay argues that this situation has more disadvantages than advantages as it takes its toll on the mental and physical health of people. Also, in this situation, individuals tend to isolate themselves from the society.  Firstly, due to recent economic slowdown it has become very hard for people to get a good job which helps them to sustain in the society. Not all jobs are paying well, so people are opting to work longer hours or work multiple jobs so that they can earn a few extra pennies to support their families. Working for longer hours stresses individuals and has many serious consequences on their physical and mental health. Moreover, a recent study conducted by World Health Organization states that 91% of people who work for longer hours are not at all happy with their lives and this has become a major cause of depression and other mental illness and also, these people tend to become sick very frequently. Secondly, by spending a major part of the day at work people do not have enough time to spend with their loved ones. This has caused a major rift in their life and many families are on the verge of collapse due to this. For example, nowadays parents do not have time to play with their children or to help them in academics due to which many children are spoiling their lives. Moreover, a recent study conducted by the Chinese government states that more than 50% of men are having problems with procreation due to the amount of stress in their lives caused as a result of working longer hours. To conclude, working longer hours has more cons than pros so people should balance their hours for work and other leisure activities. This helps people to stay happy and physically strong. Also, they will have ample amount of time to spend with their family.   Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Band 9 essay sample In many companies most of the senior level positions are occupied by men. Since many of these companies have an equal number of male and female employees, some people feel that this is unfair. In their opinion, companies should reserve a certain number of managerial positions for women. I both agree and disagree with this view. There are many reasons why I believe that companies should reserve jobs for women. First of all, women should have the same opportunities as men. Ensuring gender equality in the workplace is the easiest way to avoid gender based discrimination. Also when an equal number of men and women work at senior levels, it will make the work environment pleasant for both genders. What’s more, sometimes just knowing that a certain percent of higher positions are reserved for women can actually be an inspiration for female employees to work hard. Women also have certain qualities that make them good managers. For example, they are better at communicating and solving problems. On the flip side, reserving positions can have its fair share of disadvantages too. Companies are driven by profits and they need employees who have the skills, expertise and knowledge to take their business forward. If a certain number of senior positions are reserved for women, then companies will be required to appoint only women in those positions. This can actually pose a problem if there aren’t suitable female candidates. If companies are forced to appoint less qualified candidates, it will have a negative impact on their bottom line. To conclude, companies should strive to achieve gender equality at the workplace. However, I feel that reserving senior management positions for women is not very practical.",9,False,87.25049788378611,284
"According to some parents, children ought to read only books with educational importance and reading books for entertainment is a waste of time. In my opinion, children should not be restricted to read only certain genre of books because both the entertainment and educational books serve the purpose of imparting positive skills in children. Some parents think that children should be motivated to read only educational books and not comics and fiction which are not worth their time. They think so because educational books impart knowledge and information that help children with their studies and future progress. Furthermore, these books provide relevant and real information about incidents happening across the globe which eventually enable children to explore the world through books. Undoubtedly, I admit that the role of educational books in children’s intellectual growth is crucial and hence, undeniable. Regarding entertainment books, I do not agree with the view that reading short stories, novels or fiction for fun is a waste of time. The stories and the incidents narrated in these books conspicuously improve children’s creativity and imagination. Moreover, serious facts and events in academic texts can make reading a boring activity for them while entertainment books kindle their interest, boost their reading skills and thus, transform them into voracious readers in future. Unlike academic texts, which contain a plethora of technical terms and usages, the simple language in story books enables children to grasp the ideas easily. In conclusion, educational books are useful for developing children’s intelligence and study skills whereas entertainment books help in their overall development. Therefore, I think that reading entertainment books should not be considered as a waste of time; rather, they should be given the same importance as other books.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Write at least 250 words. These days famous people are often known for their glamour and abundance of money they have instead of their attainments. Some people believe that celebrities’ lifestyles can be bad models to teenagers. I partially agree with this view. I believe that this is not always true and young people should be responsible for their own behaviour. To begin with, media sometimes give more attention to the personal lives of well known people such as politicians and film stars in order to attract the young viewers. Majority of the teenagers are not mature enough to choose what is right and wrong. They tend to just blindly follow what they see on the television or imitate their heroes. In this way, celebrities who are supposed to be the role models of the society mislead their young fans. On the other hand, many teenagers live without being negatively influenced by the famous people. They only admire the professional side and the positive aspects of their traits. These people do not consider the celebrities’ glamour and wealth even though they are aware of these. For that reason, this group of youngsters does not want to completely copy the celebrity life. I believe that they might be trained in that way from their childhood to filter out the right things from others. Apart from that, famous personalities are just human beings. They can be attracted to wealth and glamour world. We cannot blame them for these shortcomings. It is the responsibility of young people to choose the good and discard the bad. To conclude, it is possible that young people set celebrities as their role models. It does not mean that they need to copy everything from them. I believe that youngsters should be able to adopt only the positive traits of their stars.",7,False,76.13752019386106,303
"When the joint family concept was prominent in Britain five decades ago, the aged were taken care of by their children at their residence. With the advent of the nuclear family, living in retirement homes has become the norm. I believe that the cost of this care should be borne by the government instead of the respective families. This essay will delve more into this topic. Aging is an essential aspect of human life and a peaceful stage too. In this modern age, young adults do not have the time or means to take care of their elders. As a result, the aged are left with no choice other than opting for retirement t homes. With the passage of time, the cost of living is increasing enormously. Consequently, it has become an uphill task for the youngsters to provide elderly care / eldercare. Also, it results in ill-treatment of the old or harassment in a few cases. Such incidents are happening in more than 78% of the families when funds are to be provided by the near and dear for such care. The government, on the other hand, can take care of seniors because it has the resources to do. When these people were young, they paid taxes and it is the responsibility of the government to allocate a small part of that money for their care when they become old. If the government pays of the elderly population, they can be assured of a stress free retirement life. This in turn boosts their overall sense of well-being and stops people from worrying too much about their twilight years.  To conclude, in light of the arguments mentioned above, I believe that retirement homes have to be fully funded by the government.",8,False,73.89756725514923,289
"A person’s personality determines how they will behave in a particular situation. Some people have a sunny disposition. They spread joy wherever they go. Some are always moody and anyone who interacts with them may find themselves affected by their negativity. In my opinion, personality certainly describes a person because it is the outward display of our character, values, likes and dislikes. People may be able to fake their emotions. For example, someone who is jealous of your success may actually hide that emotion and try to appear happy for you. Personality, however, cannot be faked that easily. It defines you. For instance, it is nearly impossible for an introvert person to conduct himself as an extrovert. Introverts are happy within their cocoons and have little inclination to socialize with others. They may show high levels of loyalty to the few people in their life. They may also possess higher levels of creativity and imagination because of their ability to explore the world inside. They may also make great thinkers or writers. Extroverts, on the other hand, have an outgoing personality. They are crowd pullers and make excellent leaders. They make friends wherever they go and have an agreeable disposition. Some people have an altruistic personality. They find happiness in helping others. They have a spiritual bend of mind and may even come across as unworldly. They inspire many people around them and may even have a decent following. It is nearly impossible for an altruistic person to cheat or hurt others. This personality trait makes them highly valued and respected members of the society. Often times, they put others’ interests above theirs and their family may dislike this trait of them.  In conclusion, the personality of a person provides an accurate description of their character. By simply analyzing the personality we can determine whether somebody is selfish, dependable, sociable or aloof. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The number of TV channels is increasing day by day. Some people argue that it is positive because it allows them to have more options when choosing TV programs, whilst others disagree and think it will result in a lot of low quality TV programs. This essay agrees with the argument that more TV channels offer more choice, and this is beneficial to audience. This essay will discuss both opinions by giving examples. It is clear that different channels cater to different people with different tastes / preferences. This is to say that the abundant category of TV programs makes it easier for audiences to choose from whatever they are interested in. For example, an Australian media survey shows that the TV satisfaction rate drastically improved by 5 times during the last five years because of the booming of program variety. Thus, I agree with the argument that more channels offer great benefits to audiences.  On the contrary, some people believe that only poor quality TV programs will come out if there is an excess of TV channels and market competition. They opine that in order to grab more eyeballs, they will have to cater to lower taste and create below standard programs. I disagree with this statement because there is not a uniformed standard to judge the quality of TV programs. For instance, according to a Chinese online TV review platform, reality shows, which are relaxing and entertaining, have become extremely popular among young generations; however, elderly audience always give negative comments on reality shows.   To conclude, the argument that the existence of more TV channels will dilute the quality of programs does not hold water because it is nearly impossible to judge programs using a single parameter. People have different tastes and preferences and when there are more channels everyone will have something to watch. ",8,False,80.74802074802076,305
"A child’s mind is like a piece of clay that can be moulded into any desirable form. Leisure time is a great opportunity for children to acquire useful skills and to entertain themselves. Perhaps due to this, some parents are encouraging organised activities for children while others believe in letting their children occupy themselves in their own way. I feel that children’s participation in team building activities would keep them fruitfully engaged. It will also prepare them for handling multiple endeavours in the future. Playing regular sports such as cricket, football, and badminton or attending art classes to learn musical instruments, singing, and dancing sounds productive. Children busy with these scheduled pastimes would be less prone to spend long hours on TV, phones or the internet. Additionally, they might discover their passion while pursuing these arranged activities. On the other side, some people would like to leave it up to the children to follow their interests. A free and non-coercive environment could foster creative abilities in children. For example, activities such as building a castle in the sand or crafting a prototype of a bus, train or animals foster creativity in children. Moreover, the instructive nature of sorted sessions may not interest everyone and leave them with minimal or no time for relaxation. In my opinion, I feel children should be motivated to pursue systemized undertakings in their idle time. However, they should be spared some time to ponder and tinker with things around and nurture their own hobbies. It should possibly be under careful guidance. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Children often commit acts that are cruel or immoral but they do not always realize that what they have done is wrong or unacceptable. Some people argue that punishing children is the best way to make them realize the distinction between right and wrong. While I am not an advocate of harsh forms of punishment, in my opinion, some children certainly need some forms of punishment to learn to behave. It is important for children to realize their mistakes; otherwise, they will grow up into adults who pose a threat to the wellbeing of the society. On the other hand, if they are taught the difference between right and wrong from an early age, they are more likely to become conscientious adults who care for others.  Simply asking children to behave well or do good does not always help. While some children might listen to advice, there are many others who need a deterrent. For example, in Shanghai, I often find children abusing their pets. Their parents explain to them that it is wrong again and again.  However, some children still do not mend their ways and think it is fun to be cruel to animals. In such situations, it is essential to give them some punishment so that they do not repeat the offending behaviour. When I say punishment I am not talking about corporal punishment like hitting or smacking. Parents must definitely refrain themselves from handing out such punishment to children. Instead, they can choose not to allow children to play with their favourite toy or make them sit alone until they want to behave well.  This kind of punishment can help young children realize the consequence of doing the wrong thing and they will think twice before committing the same mistake again. To draw things to a close, teaching children to learn the difference between right and right will help them to become good citizens in the future and thus lead to a decrease in the crime rate. Hence, in my opinion, parents and teachers should be allowed to use some gentle punishments to help children behave well. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"While some people are in favour of giving several short vacations to children, others opine that one long vacation is much better. In my opinion, children will benefit more if they get several short holidays during the course of the academic year. There are many advantages to short vacations. To start with, children can take a break from studies frequently. Sometimes taking a short vacation can help children get rid of their mental stress. Nowadays we see that most children attend private coaching classes after school and hence they get hardly any spare time. This can affect them mentally. However if they have a short vacation in between exams they can relax themselves, get rid of their mental stress and feel refreshed. When they get short vacation, they have enough time to spend with their loved ones. They can go to their relative’s house and spend time with them which we don’t see these days. Getting a long vacation also has its advantages. When they have long vacations they can join some coaching classes like football coaching, swimming, drawing or dancing etc. They can also travel to distant tourist destinations. However, in my opinion, in this age of intense competition and the pressure to excel in both curricular and co-curricular activities, children need small breaks from time to time to recharge themselves. To conclude, after analysing both sides of the argument it is not hard to see that there are benefits to both short and long vacations. However, considering the amount of pressure that children have to deal with on a day-to-day basis, I would recommend more short vacations than one long vacation. Do you an essay on this topic?

"Nowadays, some of the most famous people in the world are mainly known for their material possessions and image and they can have a negative influence on young people. While I admit that many famous people are popular only for their riches and looks, I do not agree with the argument that all celebrities are bad role models for the society as some of them they can be extremely inspirational for teenagers because of their hard work and lifestyle. On the one hand, there are many artists who are famous only for being rich and attractive and their behaviour often has an adverse influence on teenagers. They send out the message that in order to be famous, you only have to be rich and beautiful. There are also some who do not mind engaging in acts that are typically considered disgraceful only to grab eyeballs. A typical example of this is Paris Hilton who is famous for being a rich celebrity. She often posts glamorous photos and videos of her wearing designer costumes. She is also often spotted drinking and smoking. This glamorous and lusty lifestyle can often influence teenagers in a negative way. They only see the superficial side of fame and do not understand or appreciate the efforts that go into making one successful. On the other hand, there are some celebrities who can be a positive role model for young adults. For instance, Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the highest-paid football players in the world because of his determination, talent, and hard work. In fact, he is constantly training and working in order to build his stamina and endurance, aiming to give his best on the field. Therefore, he is extremely inspirational for children and young adults as Cristiano shows that it is essential to fight for our dreams by being a hardworking and perseverant person. Thus, some celebrities can be great role models for today’s society as they teach people pertinent lessons.

However, in my opinion, there are also some celebrities who can teach us valuable life lessons by virtue of their accomplishments in life.",8,False,73.4,367
"It is true that team sports provide more benefits to students than individual games. Students learn the importance of team work and coordination from these games and due to this students become capable of achieving better career prospects in their future.  To begin with, team games offer numerous benefits to the players. First, playing these games makes the player adaptable and flexible according to their co-players. In other words, they can adjust to some situations based on their team member’s ability. Secondly, these games instill the values of team work in a competitive environment. For instance, players in a football team already know the individual teammate’s strength and weakness and hence they work together accordingly to put the ball inside the net. Finally, playing in teams teaches the team members to share their things with others. Therefore, the ability to share and teamwork are the most valuable skills players develop when playing in teams. Furthermore, team sports help the students attain useful life lessons to shape their character in future. Caring for others is encouraged in such games and this benefits the student to be empathetic while growing up. Moreover, when they become adults, they easily adapt to the working style of their colleagues and focus more on their own job because they learned such skills from team games. To cite an example, while playing competitive games, players forget their differences and focus on the common objective of winning the game. And when they start working, this helps them to focus on their goals at work and ignore the differences between colleagues. In conclusion, team sports provide more benefits to players than individual sports. Adaptability and team work are the essential skills they develop from playing these games. These qualities help the students achieve greater success in their career. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Yes, I do feel that universities should have an equal budget for their libraries as well as  sport activities. It is our general belief that a good player can not be  good student and hence we restrict our children’s sport activities at college level. Moreover, an academic degree has much more value than sport activities which naturally compels students to focus more on their studies than their interest in sport.Most of the universities keep sports at  of their priority list,  good players do not get enough facilities and  to improve their skills and eventually they  their interest.Universities can play  substantial role in shaping this upcoming talent by providing good trainers and  which is otherwise too expensive to afford.

"Despite knowing the detrimental impact of obesity on health, people around the world are getting heavier than before. This essay will examine the major causes of this issue and suggest some viable solutions to tackle it.  The main causes of increasing body weight and decreasing fitness levels are the sedentary lifestyle of people and excessive consumption of junk food. Fast food companies are spending millions of dollars to promote their products on TV and the internet. These commercials make unhealthy food seem extremely tempting and mouth-watering. As a result, people especially children unconsciously gorge on them. Unfortunately, excessive consumption of junk leads to obesity and health problems because obese people are more likely to develop diabetes and heart trouble.  Another factor contributing to growing cases of obesity is the sedentary lifestyle of people. Due to the growing academic and work pressure, children as well as adults do not get enough time to work out. Worse, even when people are free, instead of working out in a gym, they prefer to watch a movie on the TV or computer. This way of life has a negative impact on their health.  Promoting health awareness among people and enforcing strict censorship on food advertisements are the best ways to combat this issue. The government and the media should inform people of the harmful consequences of leading an inactive life. Once the public are aware of the negative effect of obesity, they are more likely to take actions to change their lifestyle. Another solution is to ban misleading food advertisements that target children. The government must ensure that food companies are not promoting unhealthy food as healthy.  To conclude, there is no denying the fact that the growing cases of obesity and decreasing levels of health are a major concern around the world. To combat this issue, the government should launch health awareness campaigns and ban misleading ads that encourage the consumption of fast food. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Computer games are quite popular among teenagers. A number of people think this has bad influence on every aspect of the child. A few think it has some positive impact on the child’s growth. In my opinion, playing computer games certainly helps them to develop certain skills but that is at the expense of their health.  To begin with, games have been the fundamental way of teaching skills to children. Growth in technology made computer games popular among teenagers. In addition to that, playing puzzle based or strategic games develop soft skills and team build techniques. Simultaneously, virtual games have made it possible for juveniles to meet like minded people and share ideas with them. For instance, the research paper published by “Stanford University” states that children who play video games are 10 times more productive and multitasking than their peers who do not play games.  On the other hand, spending a great deal of time playing games will lead to several health related issues among children. Problems such as, back pain, joint pain and eye strain are common because most of the games played using computer require the player to sit and stare at the screen all the time. To illustrate, the number of children wearing spectacles has increased after computer games became more popular.  In conclusion, no doubt there are some pros involved in playing video games. However, these skills are achieved at the cost of health, proper care should be taken to overcome such issues so that children can enjoy quality time playing and learning.

"Any act that causes harm to another individual or a group of people, is considered as crime. Crimes are done with an intention to hurt someone intentionally. Crime rates of young offenders are definitely on the rise and researchers say that there has been over 52% increase in crime by youngers below the age of 18. Many opine that it is solely the outcome of bad parenting and that parents need be taught better parenting skills. But, I do not totally blame them for it. We live in a time and place where society plays a major role in moulding an individual. Societal pressures have both positive and negative impact on the younger generations as they tend to take in everything like a sponge. Today’s generation is exposed to a variety of digital devices through which they can watch or share anything according to their whims and fancies. Even today’s entertainment industry has become nonchalant in screening the content they broadcast and label them as ‘U’. Genres like horror, sci-fi etc now show scenes of cold blooded murder, rape and other crimes and are considered as just another snippet in the movie. News broadcasting channels are no better as they show disturbing content including videos, pictures, controversial interviews that disturb the young minds and make them ruthless. Some detractors may opine that parents have the sole control over their children and that better parenting skills would make them better children. Parents can influence the children to a certain extend and can imbibe good value system to the youngster, but other influences like friends, bad company, society, digital media also play a vital role in creating pivotal changes to the youngster’s mindset. In conclusion, I do not agree to the idea that teaching parenting skills to parents are the only way to reduce crime rate of young offenders. However, it can be one of the steps towards achieving the goal to creating a better thought process in our younger generation. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In some countries, working or travelling for a year before pursuing university studies is becoming increasingly popular among young students after completing their high school studies. This essay will discuss both the benefits and drawbacks of this trend. Working after high school enables students to gain valuable work experience which can propel their career. When students work or travel, they find great opportunities to interact with people from different walks of life and tackle various life situations. Such experiences help them overcome the inevitable challenges they are supposed to face when they eventually start working. For instance, several studies have proven that students with prior work experience or global exposure have a greater chance of growing fast in their career than those who lack one or both of them. Obviously, there are several benefits to taking a gap year after high school.  On the other hand, working or traveling after the completion of high school leads to a year gap and breaks the rhythm of studies. Some students may find working more important or interesting when they start earning. Eventually, they will give less importance to their studies. Unfortunately, this hurts their career prospects. Without good academic qualifications, it is nearly impossible to find a good job or build a successful career. Needless to say, the gap year can seriously affect the career prospects of students who lose their focus on studies. In conclusion, there are both merits and demerits to taking a year gap after high school. This can be beneficial for students who resume their studies with renewed vigor after the break. However, it is detrimental for those who fail to continue their studies.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Many people are of the opinion that parents are the best teachers and home schooling is the right approach; however, others insist that the school is the best place for their growth and development. In my view home schooling is more beneficial for the holistic development of children. Children are like hot wax and need to be cast into the right shape. Since parents know them better than anybody else, they make the best teachers at least during the formative years of a child. To further exemplify, at home children will be safe from bad company and habits. Secondly, when children spend more time at home, they develop better moral values and family ties. Both factors benefit their holistic development. Also, when they are taught at home, they can learn at a time and pace convenient to home. In addition to that, they get the undivided attention of their parent or tutor and this enables them to learn their lessons faster.  On the other hand, at school, children are taught by well-trained teachers. Also, children attending school are better disciplined. At the school they learn skills such as team work and decision making which help them become successful adults in future. Nowadays most children are part of a nuclear family and find it difficult to adjust with others and become more self- centered; however, at school they need to be with the children of different thought processes and cultures which will help them to understand the need of other children around them. Hence, children going to school are better prepared for a challenging future. To conclude, it is evident that for children’s development the skills taught at both home and the school are important, but I believe home training will be more personalized and caring.",7,False,62.37947226341204,295
"Nowadays, it is commonly found that new employees do not possess collaborative skills. Our education system and inefficient training programmes are to be blamed for this situation because they fail to emphasise on team work. However, this is not a matter of concern if team activities such as sports and group projects are made part of curriculum as well as employee induction programme. Major factors behind the lack of interpersonal skills in new employees are our education system and inept trainings offered by the organisations. Many schools and colleges concentrate on improving the academic performance of the students rather than educating them on team work. As a result, students are unaware of the concepts and significance of cooperation and combined efforts. In addition, companies fail to train their potential employees in such skills. Ultimately, new joiners lack cooperative skills as they do not have knowledge of team dynamics and work. Though the above problems are prevalent, they can be overcome by encouraging sports in education institutions and interpersonal skill development training in organisations. Through sports, students can learn how to be cooperative and understand the importance of group efforts. Nurturing these values from a young age will help them when they join firms. Companies also need to conduct training programmes for new recruits on team endeavours. For instance, if a sample project is assigned to a group as part of training, employees will not only develop their technical skills but also realise the values of group work. In summary, new employees lack interpersonal skills because schools and companies neglect the importance of developing personality traits. To tackle this problem, sports should be made a part of the curriculum and organisations should arrange training sessions to enhance interpersonal skills of the individual.

"Technology today has evolved so much that it has had a huge impact on traditional ways of living and working. Many old fashioned jobs and practices have already become extinct and some people argue that there is no point in trying to revive them. I totally agree with this view. As stated above, technology has caused / has led to rapid changes which have resulted in machines replacing men at work. A job that required 100 men before the advent of industrialisation can now be performed by just one machine, its operator and a handful of people who maintain that machine. In addition, companies have stated to make huge profits as machines do not get tired as humans do and there is only little expense involved in their maintenance. All this has resulted in loss of jobs; however, this decline in employment opportunity is only seen in the un-skilled sector. According to a survey conducted by various institutes for the years 1970-2000, technological advancement has affected 75% of un-skilled jobs and only 10% of skilled jobs. Furthermore, there is an increase in the number of skilled jobs and new sectors have come into existence during this period creating 30 million jobs every year. Obviously, there is no point in making policies to preserve the jobs which are bound to vanish with the time.  I would like to conclude that although technological changes have resulted in the loss of some jobs it also generated new job opportunities thus no effort is required from the law makers to save what are to be gone.

"Essay submitted by the student Children’s choice of their role model is a complicated process that is governed by circumstances and personality. However, I believe that choosing to follow like-minded friends’ influence has become the dominant trend amongst our children. Thus, I would have to concur with such an observation. There is a significant generational gap between youngsters and their parents. Due to the recent revolution in communications, which is embodied in the invention of the internet, mobile phones and laptops, children are indirectly compelled to embrace a more globalized culture. Hence, parents find it difficult to communicate with their children as parents’ and their children’s background becomes too different from each other’s. For example, a parent born in the 50s will find it difficult to understand pop and rock culture that seems to be widespread amongst today’s youth. Circumstances change individual’s choices. Parents tend to want their children to replicate their methods and approachs in life. However, children find difficulty in complying with their parents’ wish to adopt their methods as circumstances have changed. As a result, children would abandon his parents’ ways and follow other like-minded people’s ways. For example, parents usually would want their children to marry earlier. This is not applicable nowadays due to a more challenging economic situation. In conclusion, children, compelled by circumstances and a more globalized environment, would have to abandon their parent’s advice as it has become no longer applicable in our world. This might seem like a negative thing, however, I believe that it is a peculiarity of a more independent generation that is able to think critically.

"Schooling is an important phase in a child’s life and plays a pivotal role in their overall development. In some European countries, some young children study practical skills in schools that will help them to secure a job in the future; however, others prefer schools providing a more generalized academic education. This essay will discuss the steps schools can take to prepare students for their career.  Indeed, the overall structure of the building matters, but a strong foundation is what holds the building tall in the future. At a tender age, schools should focus on the overall academic development of the children and not on getting them job-ready. For example, communication classes should be made compulsory for high school students so that they develop an inquisitive personality. At the age of 11 or 13, children are too young to understand the needs of the job market and instilling practical skills in them will only pressurise their young minds.  Furthermore, schools can initiate corporate training programs like internships for higher classes and promote learning through recreation for younger children. For instance, lectures by company heads can be arranged to give first hand experiences to high school students who are getting ready for the workplace. Perhaps, through interactive games, younger children can be taught life skills like team work that they will use throughout their lives.  In a nut-shell, this essay discussed the various steps schools can take to prepare the students for the corporate world. Teachers must make sure the focus of young children is on academic learning and as they reach higher classes, more emphasis can be laid on getting them job ready. Through an adequate mix of life skills teaching and vocational training programs, schools can produce job-ready individuals.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Improvements in health, education and trade are essential for the development of poorer nations. Some say that the governments of richer nations should take more responsibility for helping the poorer nations in such areas. In my opinion, the aid of wealthy countries is imperative to fight poverty in developing nations.Today’s world has been divided into developing and industrialised countries  the main difference between them is the amount of money that governments apply in important sectors such as education, health and commerce. Most of the poorer nations are buried in debts as a result of their unbalanced finances which  in a  health care, an unstructured education system and a weak international trade. This vicious cycle will continue indefinitely unless wealthier nations show interest in minimizing the worldwide economic differences, as well as taking more responsibility for assisting less fortunate countries.Most of the African countries live in  conditions because of the extreme poverty, upheaval, hunger, disease, unemployment, lack of education and both inexperienced and corrupt administrations. The devastating consequences of the AIDS epidemic in those countries could improve if the infected population were to receive free drugs to control the disease, have access to health professionals and get information on how to prevent its spread. But this can only be achieved through international help programs in which leaders of the world’s richest countries donate medicine and also send doctors and nurses to treat and educate those in need.Moreover, most of the poor countries rely on selling agricultural products and raw materials to rich nations and buying industrialized products from them  in a huge financial deficit. Consequently, they borrow a significant amount of money from the World Bank to try to improve their broken economies, but sometimes the money disappears with no significant changes and they cannot even pay the interest to the bank. Recognising this as an issue that wealthy countries can resolve, last year the G8, which is comprised of leaders of the eight richest nations, decided to forgive billions of dollars worth of debt owed by the world’s poorest nations. In addition, they developed adequate loan programs to financially assist those countries.In conclusion, leaders of the  countries play an indispensable role in assisting developing nations in dealing with essential areas such as health, education and trade.

We will first discuss how such events reduce international worries and then see whether these events are safe.  International sporting events help us to forget all our internal worries and grudges for some time. It is seen that while watching any sport, people get themselves completely involved in cheering their own countries and they completely enjoy this moment. Audience normally do not recall any internal tensions during this period; they express their patriotic emotions for their country and root for their team. Such feelings bring the entire nation together to cheer for their players to win and succeed. Furthermore, the sports culture is very safe as because there are strict rules and regulations under which the games are performed; therefore the environment is highly safe for everyone. Unlike in wars, where there are destructions and losses in sports we freely participate to show our skills and love for our country without caring much about any personal losses, even though there are injuries but medical assistance is provided. Such type of occasions reduces internal disputes because people from all over the world participate to portray their best skills for winning for their country.

"Discuss your opinion on how modernism can affect our health. What can the government do to overcome such situations? Owning to the realisation of the importance of health, people have become increasingly concerned about the negative impact of modernism on their physical and mental health. In this essay, I would like to explore the downside of modernism on our health and will also provide some measures to overcome them. It is obvious that there are numerous demerits of modernisation especially on our health. To start with, one of the negative aspects of modernism is a change in eating habits. Nowadays, most of the people prefer fast food and processed food which are less nutritious with high fat and salt content, instead of home cooked and organic food. As a result, people have become overweight which is one of the risk factors for heart disease, hypertension and high cholesterol. Another disadvantage of modernism is encouraging people to do less exercise. For instance, most people choose to use lift or escalator rather than staircases, drive rather than walk and enjoy doing indoor rather than outdoor activities. It is undeniable that these modern behaviours and lifestyles are contributing to our ill health. Last but not least, consumerism and materialism which are the outcome of modernism make people workaholics and provide unnecessary physical and mental stress. Therefore, many people have had nervous breakdowns. Many actions can be taken to combat the negative effects of modernism. The best way to do this is educating people on how to live a healthy life through media by the government .There should be a ban on the advertisement of fast food and the consumer should be fully informed about the danger of fast food with clear instruction on the packaging. Moreover, the government should encourage people to walk which is not only a healthier choice but also environmental friendly than driving, by constructing pedestrian and walking paths and increasing tax for car users. Finally, the government should implement rules and regulations to fix working hours in order to avoid overwork .This would give people more time to rest and exercise. To conclude, modernism can be very distressing for one’s health and both governments and individuals should take responsibility to lessen these effects.",7,False,83.9183227651144,374

Nowadays, people are travelling due to various reasons, such as education, business and recreation. Globalisation has opened up the boundaries of the countries and provided ample opportunities. It is through globalisation that we are now able to expand our scopes of horizon across other nations. For instance, it is seen that students are applying to international colleges for further studies, this is mainly because of globalisation and it is noticed that there are more students enrolling for international studies than in the past. There are many benefits that we get while travelling. One of the merits is that we learn about many different cultures and this actually assists us in making our bonds with other nations stronger. We also learn to respect the culture and values of other nations. This further assists us in showcasing our own culture on an international platform. As a result, it opens up the scope for any kind of support from the international countries. Furthermore, travelling has an impact on the growth of the travel industry.

The products have boosted the companies’ sales which in turn have increased their investment in preserving traditional skills for further developing their technologies.To conclude, traditional skills and  are increasingly becoming a useful alternative to the homogeneity brought by global applications of modern technologies.

"Some people argue that in the modern society, technological advancements are increasing the gap between the wealthy and the poor while others believe that technology is decreasing the gap between them. In my opinion, certain technologies are available to all people in the society and help reduce the gap between the rich and the poor. However, certain innovations are inaccessible to the poor because of their high cost. Certain inventions and discoveries decreased the gap between people of different income levels. This is because they are accessible to all people due to their availability at cheaper rates. For example, the internet technology is available to almost all sections of the society. It is affordable to all people and certain places such as railway stations, bus stations and airport are WiFi hotspots where internet is freely available. Online shopping facilities, e-learning opportunities and social networking sites are available to both affluent and poor people in the society and they decrease the gap between the rich and the poor. However, certain advancements in technology are not affordable for the poorer sections of the society. Modern medicine, for example, is expensive.

"In recent times, e-tools such as laptop have gained currency in school classrooms as they have changed the traditional style of education. As a result, a few schools assert that every student should have their personal laptop in the classroom. In my opinion, the adoption of advanced technology certainly benefits students; however, there are some drawbacks attached to it. To begin with, extensive usage of laptop in the classroom has many advantages. Firstly, the students can do their assignments effectively as all the information is available at just one click. This will lead to better usage of study time as children do not need to run to faraway libraries for the collection of materials. Moreover, integrating e-learning with the existing pedagogy makes learning easier, faster and better. For instance, 3-D explanation of molecular geometry is only possible with the help of computers. Besides this, online teaching can be eco-friendly as it saves a lot of paper and thus reduces rubbish and garbage dump. On the other hand, there are a few demerits attached to /associated with excessive usage of laptop in the classroom. First and foremost, it can sap students’ creativity level because of the readymade availability of the content. So, no one bothers to use their brains and intelligence to think out of the box. Consequently, it hampers the cognitive development of children. Additionally, students use their laptop for making notes and doing homework which have an adverse impact on writing skill. To illustrate, autocorrect function in laptop easily corrects the spelling mistakes and the grammatical errors thereby giving an illusion to the child that everything written is correct. In conclusion, I would reiterate that the world is going to get more automated in near future; therefore, it is better to introduce laptops in classrooms on mandatory basis.

"It is argued that governments are wasting their resources by paying for the preservation of arts and that they would be better off spending the funds on public sectors. While it is crucial to increase spending on public services such as education or transportation, governments should not cut all their expenses on arts. On the one hand, improving public services is crucial for the development of a country. For example, when the funds are utilised for traffic projects like road maintenance or public transportation, the number of traffic accidents will reduce, and people can plan their trips better around the city thanks to frequent bus and train services. Furthermore, with sufficient funding, the authorities can keep public workers happy and avoid their going on strikes. Imagine all teachers in a city stop teaching for a day to protest against low wages. It would lead to classes being cancelled, and parents having to stay home to look after their schoolchildren. That would be a very troublesome / difficult situation for families and offices alike. On the other hand, it is equally important to spend on arts. If the officials decided to stop spending on music and theatre, it would be a serious mistake and could result in the loss of national identity. We all know that arts and culture are interrelated. If a country does not emphasize on preserving arts, the cultural aspects associated with traditional music and theatre will gradually disappear. The nation will in turn lose their cultural uniqueness, which is of great importance for tourism. If travellers find nothing extraordinary about a culture, it is less likely that they will make that country their desired destination. In conclusion, I am against the idea of governments cutting all investment in arts to spend on public services. The authorities should balance their spending between these two sectors so public services can operate smoothly and at the same time cultural diversity and uniqueness can be maintained.

"It is indeed true that the number of cars on the roads is increasing day by day in developing nations. While there are some potential downsides to this development such as traffic congestion and environmental pollution, I believe that necessary steps can be taken to curb the problem. Numerous problems will arise when more and more people buy cars. One of the obvious problems is that it will lead to traffic congestion in the cities. As a result, people have to waste their precious time and also there is unnecessary waste of fossil fuels when people stay for a longer time in traffic jams. For example, in my country India, people in most of the major cities like Delhi and Banglore, spend hours in traffic during peak hours. Another potential problem will be environmental pollution. If the number of cars increases, it will lead to more pollution in the environment. Most cars run on petrol and diesel and they emit harmful gases which will cause in depletion of the ozone layer.  However, I believe that switching to electric vehicles would be the best possible solution to curb down pollution. Electronic vehicles run on batteries which can be recharged. Also, they emit minimal waste to the environment. That is why the government should invest more in such projects. Apart from that the government should encourage people to use public transport or do carpooling. This is because it will lower the number of cars on the road and also reduce the level of air pollution. In conclusion, I reiterate that the increasing number of cars will lead to potential problems; however, switching to electronic mode of transport and encouraging people to share rides would minimise the problems.

"Success is an abstract concept and it means different things to different people.  Among the many factors that contribute to success, some people believe that a good memory is the most important one. I partly agree with them, since I believe that this hinges on the specific success they aspire to achieve. On the one hand, there are several lines of evidence supporting the view that excellent memories are the most significant prerequisite for an individual’s success. That is because memory is the process of reproducing what has been learned and retained especially through the associative mechanisms. This can help students achieve efficient learning and get good grades in academic exams. For example, a survey proved that 80% of students in top universities have better memory than those in ordinary universities. Obviously, memory plays an important role in preparing you for success. However, myriads of people possess different definitions of success which are not always affected by a person’s ability to memorize. For instance, for an athlete, success means winning more and more medals. Such success is attributed to their endless training and has nothing to do with their ability to memorize things. Besides, some people define their success as their better relationships with their friends and family members. Maintaining such relationships does not require a stellar memory; instead they depend on mutual understanding and cooperation. In conclusion, different people have different definitions of success, so the most important contributor of their success is different, and as a result, a good memory is a facilitator of success for some people but it is not helpful for others.",8,False,60.03750870271525,266
"Nowadays many employees lack interpersonal qualities such as communication skills or team spirit. This could be due to the inadequacies of our education system and the method of interview used to select employees. Both problems need to be addressed to find a solution. The most predominant factor which leads to lack of interpersonal skills in potential employees is our education system itself. To elaborate, academic success of students is measured in terms of their ability to grasp voluminous syllabus with little focus / emphasis on extracurricular activities. Employers also give preference to candidates with good academic grades. Consequently, students focus on improving their scores in exams rather than participating in sports and other events, which may enhance their interpersonal skills. To tackle this problem, it is important to change the grading criteria of students and the selection method of employees. If students are given extra marks for participating in a college function or stage programme, they will make these activities a part of their study life. And when they work with their college mates they will acquire useful skills such as teamwork, interpersonal communication or leadership. Furthermore, instead of focusing solely on their academic grades, interviewers should test candidates from various aspects to judge their true potential. For instance, group discussion before an interview can be used to analyse how participants accept others’ opinion or how they react to differing views. In conclusion, our faulty grading system and the focus on academic success are the reasons for the lack of interpersonal skills among employees. The only solution to this problem is to make extracurricular activities an integral part of the learning process.  ",8,False,92.28053733208372,271
"Excessive consumption of fatty foods leads to a lot of health problems. Some people believe that creating awareness about the health consequences of junk food is the solution to this problem. Others, however, feel that other measures are required to tackle this issue. In my opinion, creating awareness is important but that alone will not work. Most people lead a hectic life these days. They do not have the time or energy to cook proper meals. As a result, they subsist on fast food. Many of them are actually aware of the ill effects of fast food; yet they consume it because they prefer convenience to health. Such people will not stop eating junk foods even if the government launches awareness campaigns against such foods. There are also some people who consume fast food because they are ignorant of the consequences of fast food consumption. Awareness campaigns will work best amongst them. As we have seen, in many cases lack of awareness is not the factor that encourages the consumption of fast foods. Therefore other actions are also required to deal with this problem. People who eat fast food in spite of knowing that it is unhealthy may stop eating it if the government makes it unaffordable by increasing taxes on it. Even this measure will not deter wealthy people from consuming fast foods. Perhaps a better solution is to make healthy food more affordable and accessible. The government can perhaps open eateries that serve healthy food at reasonable prices. In Tamil Nadu, for example, there are state funded canteens that serve healthy foods for a nominal price. When healthy options are available conveniently at least some people will give up fast food. To conclude, creating awareness about the harmful effects of fast foods is certainly important but it will not solve the problem. In addition to creating awareness, the government has to take measures that make fast foods unaffordable and healthy foods more accessible.  ",9,False,72.61169074626412,325
"In this commercialized / globalized world, many countries are importing goods from other countries for local consumption. In my opinion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to this practice.  To start with the advantages, the import of goods improves the living standards of people and also keeps prices in check. For example, when goods are imported from abroad, local manufacturers cannot increase their prices beyond a certain level. This benefits the customer. In addition, this practice makes high quality foreign products available in the local market. For example, almost all countries import smart phones made by acclaimed brands like Apple. If these are not imported people in many developing countries will have to be content with whatever is locally available. Importing also increases competition in the market and this will encourage the local manufacturers to innovate to stay competitive. In short there are many benefits to importing goods. On the flip side, if imported goods flood the local market, it will break the back of the local economy. When retailers can easily import cheap goods from abroad, local manufacturers will be forced to reduce the prices of their products. While this makes goods more affordable for the end user, it can hurt the interests of local businesses and they will be forced to shut shop. Eventually, this will lead to unemployment. Another disadvantage of importing is that it is not good for the environment. When goods have to be transported thousands of miles, more fossil fuels have to be burnt and this leads to the emission of more greenhouse gases. In short, there are certainly some benefits to importing goods. However, if a product is already available in the local market, its import should be discouraged to protect the interests of the local economy. It is also important to consider the environmental consequences of transporting goods long distances.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is considered by many people that the news media must be unbiased and report news as it is. In my opinion, much of the news which we receive is either biased or false. The role of a newspaper is to review and deliver the truth and keep the readers informed of it. Although much of the news which is gathered by the media is fair, it is not always delivered to readers. In other words they exaggerate the news in order to draw the attention of readers. Sensationalised stories will make the public watch the news channels or read newspapers regularly. For instance, in the US, the news channels now portray only the negative aspects of their President. While it is true that Trump has his shortcomings as a person and an administration, it is wrong to assume that he is a total failure. Yet, that is the impression one gets when one reads American newspapers. This kind of reporting unfortunately does not benefit the country or its people. Overall, the media is subjective because their own concern is protecting their business interests and propagating their ideologies. The primary function of a newspaper is to provide authentic information about various happenings around the world. When reported objectively, it is beneficial to the readers. For example, if the media is unbiased, and reports news as it is, it can help its readers vote the right government to power. Likewise, it can help people choose the right products and services for their needs. Another significant role of a newspaper is to accurately interpret and analyze the news. Most news papers have an editorial column which analyses a major news item. This column usually gives the opinion of the news editor or newspaper management. Presenting a fair analysis is vital because people newspaper editorials play a crucial role in shaping public opinion.  In conclusion, this essay discussed why media houses prefer subjective reporting and the downsides of this trend. It also narrated the role of a newspaper in delivering and interpreting news.

"For the holistic development of children, schools should have a perfect mix of academic as well as non-academic subjects. According to some people, it should be made compulsory for students to learn music, acting and creative writing. I agree with this viewpoint as learning these subjects will enhance their creative skills, and they will also get a much needed break from regular subjects. To begin with, having extracurricular subjects such as arts, drama and creative writing in the syllabus helps students enormously. This is because when students learn these courses, it enables them to develop their creative, thinking and imaginative skills, which are beneficial for learning academic subjects. For instance, it is easier for a student with higher imagination capabilities to solve a complex mathematics problem. Additionally, some children are blessed with artistic skills so these classes will give them a platform where they can develop these abilities further and perfect them. Another benefit of having non-academic subject in the syllabus is that it alleviates the academic pressure on children. These subjects give students a much needed break from their regular academic curriculum. Undoubtedly, competition among students has increased which can sometimes lead to stress. Therefore, it has become imperative for both schools and parents to let children spend some time doing activities which can give them a chance to relax their mind and body. For this reason, many schools have already included such subjects as part of their syllabus. If, however, students are not given this break, it will become difficult for them to stay focused, motivated and enthusiastic in other subjects because of stress. To conclude, including arts, drama and creative writing in school curriculum will help students to reap rich benefits by strengthening their thinking power and relaxing their mind; therefore, they should be made a mandatory part of school syllabus.

"Scientific research plays a very important role in the progress of a nation. It is argued that research should be controlled and funded by the government, and not private organisations or institutions. This essay agrees with the argument that the government should carry out various research works in different fields and will outline the reasons why government should be responsible for research projects. There are several reasons to support my view point. Firstly, the government is capable of providing financial assistance to various research projects. Moreover, if the project fails to achieve its objectives, the government has the resources to cope up with the losses incurred. Secondly, the main motive of the government in conducting research is public welfare. Thirdly, when government funds research activities, there is utmost security. They do not disclose any information which could hamper national security. That is why research and development in the field of military is carried out by the government. When private organisations conduct research, their chief concern is protecting their interests. This explains why the research conducted by coffee companies or gum companies only highlights the benefits of their products. This is not the case when the government funds research. In this case, the final verdict is more likely to be unbiased. To conclude, after analysing the various aspects of the argument, it is not hard to see that the government funding of research is in the interests of the public. Private organizations, on the other hand, may have their own vexed interests to protect.",8,False,54.09023941068139,253
"A certain group of people believe that a day without cars is an effective way to lessen air pollution in many countries. However, some others think differently and insist / argue that there are several alternative ways to maintain air purity. In this essay, I will discuss both views before arriving at a conclusion. The combustion of fossil fuels in vehicles leads to the emission of harmful gases like carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Diminishing air quality is one of the immediate effects of this emission. A car free day will certainly reduce emission and improve air quality on that day and perhaps on the next day as well; however, it is not a permanent solution because the air quality will worsen as soon as cars return to roads. A better solution is to reduce or completely stop the burning of coal and other fossil fuels by switching to alternate sources of energy.  A lion’s share of world electricity production is from thermal power plants which use coal as a fuel to generate energy. Thus it is evident that coal is one of the major causes of pollution and its consumption must be reduced. Even though electric vehicles are better alternatives to fossil fuel powered engines, the atmospheric pollution caused by electricity generation from coal is alarmingly increasing. In conclusion, a car-free day alone does not help much in reducing air pollution. A better solution is to identify and avoid major pollutants. Therefore, in my opinion, limiting the use of coal and exploring renewable sources like solar and hydropower are more effective ways to reduce air pollution.",7,False,68.57245653892255,266
"Museums of different kinds, exhibiting objects of historical, cultural and scientific values have always enjoyed great significance in the society. However, most of these museums, in recent years, do not provide free access to the visitors. Although this change might lead to a negative consequence, such as a decline in the number of visitors, it definitely offers more benefits to the museum and the society. In my opinion, it is far better to charge an entry fee than allowing anyone and everyone inside for free. Firstly, these institutions do not have any source of revenue other than the funds received from the government’s budget. Thus, the greatest advantage of this development is that the admission charges can actually generate and augment their income, which in turn can be used to pay the salary of the employees working there and also for the renovation and conservation of its infrastructure. A good illustration of this is the Madame Tussauds Museum in London. Despite the ticket prices being exorbitantly high, it has been drawing tourists because of its quality and innovation. Furthermore, the visits of beggars and lovers, who come here for personal objectives and not to understand the real importance of museums will be hindered, thus providing a hassle-free entry to others who actually want to gain knowledge.  However, there are a few challenges which the museum and the public might have to face owing to the entry fee. Firstly, every citizen has the right to receive access to a place which is culturally and historically important for them; hence, in this sense, the introduction of the admission fee violates their right to knowledge and information.  To illustrate, the admission fee may stand in the way of poor/financially weak people who are genuinely interested in gathering information.  In conclusion, charging an entry fee may certainly reduce the number of people visiting the museum; however, it generates revenue which can be used for the proper maintenance of the place. Over time, this may actually increase the number of visitors; hence, in my opinion, the advantages of collecting a fee from the visitors outweigh the disadvantages.

"Science and technology has penetrated almost all facets of human lives and food industry is not exempted from getting the benefits of this. While some people believe that the changes in the scientifically altered foods are beneficial to the mankind, others assert that they are affecting the health of the people adversely. I certainly agree with the latter viewpoint. There are many advantages to altering the genetic property of foods. First, to meet the surging demands of the public several produces such as crops, cereals, fruits and vegetables, are genetically modified; consequently, those can be produced in abundance. Besides this, genetic engineering has enabled farmers to grow crops in less time. Second, the busy lifestyle in the present era compels many people to consume ready to eat meals. Hence, foods are packaged and preserved using scientific methodologies to increase their shelf life so that they can be consumed even months later. On the other hand, this process raises some concerns as well. To begin with, it has been observed that people experience difficulty in digesting the genetically altered foods. In other words, simple forms of foods are always good for health and easily digestible as compared to the altered foods. For instance, the scientifically modified crop corn creates a lot of digestive problems among people these days. Next, the packaged foods have excess amount of oil, sugar, salt, synthetic chemicals and preservatives which are disastrous to health and this might cause cholesterol, obesity, diabetes and other health hazards. To recapitulate, there are certainly some valid reasons to scientifically alter the foods we consume; however, considering the potential health consequences that may arise due to this, I am against this practice.

"The following is an essay submitted by one of our students.  Due to globalization, more and more people are now travelling to other countries for many purposes such as higher studies, business, medical treatment, immigration etc. Some people think that host culture should be followed by visitors of other countries. On the other hand, some people argue that it is imperative that cultural diversity is given importance by the host country. In my opinion, the host country should always embrace disparate cultures from all over the world rather than imposing their culture on them. There is a wide range of advantages of following diverse culture. Firstly, when there is a cosmopolitan environment in the country, then it develops a sense of tolerance in the local people. This would be helpful to them when they visit other country. Moreover, Diversity in culture always brings novelties. People can experience new traditions and customs with wide range of differences in food, languages, clothes, rituals, etc. This can be exemplified by growth rate and development in US and European countries. They always welcome cultural differences. Furthermore, cultural diversity brings unity and a feeling of brotherhood among the people. Although a country can be benefited by cultural diversity, local customs and traditions should be given equal importance as well. When People from other countries simultaneously follow local culture then it may helpful to them in bridging the gap of discrimination. Everybody will be given equal chance to grow and develop in the country. To conclude, host country should always welcome diverse people with diverse culture from all over the world.

"Holidays are crucial for many people. For this reason some employees seek jobs / careers in fields that allow them more time off. Some people claim that this is unfair and argue that all jobs should have the same number of holidays. I disagree with this view for several reasons. First of all, some jobs are more tiring than others. Office jobs, for example, are less exhausting than roles like teaching or working in a mine. Based on my personal experience, I know that teaching students, especially teenagers, is far more exhausting than doing some other jobs. Hence, certain jobs deserve and require more time off than others.  Secondly, some jobs can be performed only during certain months / periods of the year. Jobs like forest fire fighting or fruit picking are available only in the summer. Obviously, people employed in such sectors can have more holidays than others. At the same time, there are certain jobs that are so important that the holders of those jobs cannot have too many holidays. For example, a police officer cannot afford to have too many holidays because if they do not report to duty, the law and order situation will go out of control. Doctors and nurses also cannot have too many holidays because their service is crucial for keeping the society healthy.  To conclude, after analysing the situation it is not hard to see that different jobs have different requirements and some jobs are mentally and physically more demanding. In my opinion, people holding such jobs should have more holidays than those who have less stressful jobs. Hence, I agree with the argument that the number of holidays should be determined by the nature of the job. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Obesity is one of the major concerns we face today. Some individuals believe that the government is responsible for the increased incidents of obesity among children.  Whilst, others argue that parents are accountable. In this essay, I will discuss both sides of the argument and provide my opinion. It is true that the government could have taken preventive measures to control obesity in children. The government could pass regulations that require food companies to produce chocolates, cheese and chips with more nutrients. These regulations will force companies to sell their food products at higher prices. This, in turn, will reduce their consumption and when consumption of junk foods decreases, incidents of obesity will also decrease. For example, New York Times reported that children of New York are less obese than children of other states in the US because the local government there regulated the food industry a long time ago. However, government intervention alone will not prevent obesity in children. Parents have an equally important role to play. They should monitor their children’s eating habits to control obesity. Nowadays, many parents work long hours to feed their children, but they do not realize that the food that they serve is not of high quality. This is another reason for the increase in childhood obesity. So parents must find the time to cook proper meals for their children. If both of them are busy, they can share this responsibility between themselves. This way obesity can be controlled or eliminated. In conclusion, both the government and the parents can play an important role in controlling childhood obesity. The government should regulate the food industry and parents should serve healthy home cooked meals.",8,False,71.36042402826854,280
"Some people are of the opinion that people should live inside the cities instead of living on the outskirts of the city in order to solve the traffic and transportation problems. In my honest opinion, this is not practically feasible for a large number of people residing in suburban and rural areas. I will decipher my views with relevant explanations. Encouraging the people to move to / into cities is not practically possible due to the limited size of cities and the difference in people’s accommodation preferences. This is because cities are of compact sizes as compared to suburbs around them, and it will not be possible for cities to accommodate the large population living in suburban households. Another reason for this might be might be the difference in people’s choice of living as some may want to enjoy the suburban or rural lifestyle. For instance, cities are already a bit cramped all over the world, and they will never ever be able to provide the countryside atmosphere. As a result, traffic and transportation problem will still persist despite this idea. On the other hand, alternative solutions can be found for traffic and transportation problems. In other words, people should be encouraged to work from home when they can as a way to reduce road congestion and commuting problem. To illustrate, if there are fewer people coming to cities for work, there will be no congestion and no transportation issues. Also, the government should try to provide more job opportunities in the countryside by encouraging industries to set up their factories there. When jobs are available in small towns and villages, there will be a sharp decline in the number of people traveling to cities. This will effectively reduce transportation problems in the metros.  In conclusion, it is not practical to encourage rural people to move into space starved urban areas to solve traffic problems. A better solution is to create more employment opportunities in the countryside.",8,False,60.33990825688073,326
"In modern day society, it has become common to make copyright protected material freely available on the Internet with the result that the owners of the work lose large sums of money. The discussion of whether or not this distribution is of positive or negative nature has therefore been raised. Personally, I believe that this issue has both negative and positive effects.Distributing copyright protected material freely online can firstly help make this material more popular. Often people are not willing to spend money on a film or song before being exposed to it once, as they cannot be sure that they will enjoy the material they are about to purchase. If they purchase a song or film and then do not like it, the money spent will have been wasted, which is disappointing. Frequently, people purchase copyright protected material that they enjoyed after being exposed to it once, meaning that often owners often receive money at a later stage. An owner’s reputation can additionally improve, because frequently owners who allow their work to be distributed partially or completely online have a more positive reputation amongst customers.Regardless of the positive effects of the free online distribution of copyright protected material, it can be said that this distribution has several negative effects. Firstly, owners lose large sums of money through it. A lot of time and money can be spent producing the material distributed, as certain spaces and equipment must be rented or bought to produce a certain song or film. Like all other people, artists need money to survive and thus are at a disadvantage when they do not receive money for their work. I personally believe therefore that governments should make sure that when something is performed in public or when work is displayed in public, artists should receive credit and money.In conclusion, it can be said that the online distribution of copyright protected material has both negative and positive effects. In my opinion, it cannot fully be determined whether this distribution is of a positive or negative nature; one must decide upon this for oneself.",9,False,76.04356325492688,346
"It is true that some criminals commit crimes again after they have been punished. While there are several reasons for this alarming trend, some effective measures can be taken by governments to tackle this problem.There are two main reasons for re-offenders. Firstly, the prison system can make the situation worse. Criminals put together in prison and they make friends with other offenders. While they are locked up in prison, they do not have much to do there, and they would exchange information about what they have done before they came to the prison or they may plan crimes with other inmates. Secondly, offenders often do not have any other means of earning money. They are poor, uneducated and lacking skills needed to maintain a job. Also, a criminal record makes finding a job difficult as people usually avoid hiring .To solve this problem, governments should focus on rehabilitation of criminals rather than punishment. Above all, prisons need vocational training which  inmates to prepare for life outside the prison. They can learn practical skills such as computer programming, car maintenance and graphic design. In this way, they can be hired for a position that requires this certain knowledge and skills. Community service is another way to reform offenders. Rather than being locked up in prison with other inmates, offenders can help society and become useful to their local community, and these activities would eliminate the negative influence that prisons can have.In conclusion, it is true the  one of the problems  our community; it can be solved by focusing  rather than punishment itself.",8,False,90.46005675938412,261
"According to some people, happiness peaks during adolescence while for others this occurs during adulthood despite all the challenges posed by it. Both views will be discussed in this essay before drawing a conclusion.  The transitional stage from childhood to adulthood is often considered to be the happiest.  Adolescents have no adult-type responsibilities apart from their daily routine of sleeping, eating, studying and enjoying.  Teenage is the time for experimentation and most children at this age self-discover how creative and talented they can be.  For instance, interviews of many famous artists revealed that they uncovered their skills between the ages 13 and 18, and those were the happiest days of their life since they performed for pleasure only. In contrast, entering adult life means you survived adolescence.  For these people, happiness is defined by a successful career and a well-paid stable job.  At this age, people have attained physical and mental maturity.  Adults are free to make their own decisions and live their life as they desire.  Moreover, life becomes complete after marriage since you have a partner to share all your happiness. Sixty percent of the participants in a survey conducted by The Guardian said that their happiness was at its peak during their adulthood despite all job challenges and family responsibilities. To conclude, happiness is defined in many different ways. Being able to lead a carefree life is what makes teenagers happy whereas for adults it is their achievements. I personally believe that the happiness curve fluctuates for each individual and cannot be attributed to any specific age. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Nowadays, hard copies of books are being replaced by their electronic versions. eBooks certainly have several advantages over their printed versions. They do not occupy space or carry weight. Also, they are up to date. Even so, I cannot agree with the argument that university libraries should start offering eBooks alone. Despite the many advantages electronic books have, they still have a few disadvantages. The main advantage of eBooks is that they are much less expensive than paper based books. They do not wear out or occupy space. In fact, thousands of eBooks can be stored on a small device like a smart phone or a tablet. People can carry them on their mobile device wherever they go and read them whenever they want. Also, eBooks are updated frequently. This enables readers to have access to the latest information on the subject. Nevertheless, eBooks do have certain disadvantages. To start with, in order to read them, people have to invest in an eBook reader or another gadget like a smart phone. These devices can be expensive and a university library may not be able to buy enough of them so that every student can read. Another disadvantage is that if the device malfunctions, students will not be able to read books stored on it. A weak battery or a power outage can also render these devices useless and make the books stored on them inaccessible.

"Recently, it has been a trend for tourists to visit places with harsh conditions. Some people will have a unique experience traveling to these places because it is something that you do not live in your daily life. However, there are some downsides for this kind of trips where the people´s health or physical condition might be compromised. This essay will show both sides. Visiting a place with a threat to your life may be exciting for some travelers and this feeling could benefit your appreciation for life and health. People are amused by the sort of scenery and landscape that they might find in isolated places where the human being has not touch any of nature. Therefore, they may find a connection with themselves and feel a relief of their lives looking for a new purpose that they did not have before they witness the wonders of the world. Also, for some people traveling to inhabited and peaceful places could improve their health in several ways. For example, It was reported by The University of Cambridge in 2016 that people who lived for a month in the Brazilian Jungle improved their sight by sixty percent in comparison to those who lived in the city with their regular life. On the other hand, traveling to landmarks with difficult conditions might create a problem to those tourists who are mentally weak or technology based. The isolation feeling could make you feel homesick and start crying or feeling depressed and not finishing your trip without even visiting the best parts yet. To illustrate, a survey done by The Institute of Tourism in Africa showed that almost twenty-five percent of tourists crossing the Sahara desert did not finish the tour because they were feeling isolated and the conditions were too extreme for them, The result was that they had to be evacuated by an emergency helicopter. Also for those, who are technology dependent this experience might be frustrating as they cannot be on-line with the modern world. People, who are frequently connected via internet might find the experience bored because in those places there are not internet connection or cafes and this can be a huge drawback for these travelers. To conclude, exploring places that have an uncommon condition could be a positive trip for some people looking for a spiritual experience or a health improvement. However, for those who are afraid of losing their comfort zone and the connection with the 21st century, this kind of excursion might be a disappointing idea due to the facilities that these places lack.",7,False,77.15960341671752,427
"It is true that shopping malls have had a profound impact on the business of small shops and as a result of this, many local vendors have closed their shops. In my opinion, it is a positive development due to the number of advantages offered by shopping complexes. Large shopping malls are preferred shopping places for the vast majority of people. This is primarily because these malls provide one stop solution to every need of their customers. These places sell everything, such as branded clothes, kitchen appliances and electronic gadgets, that their customer wants. Apart from catering to the shopping needs, these places act as a perfect picnic spot for many families as there are food courts and cinema halls in the same building. Many people prefer to spend their leisure time at these spaces and rejuvenate themselves. Large shopping malls have also removed major inconveniences such as the lack of parking facilities and time taken to travel from one shop to the other. As these malls are situated in a large building, dedicated parking space is available for consumers to park their vehicle. They can enjoy their shopping without worrying about their vehicles being towed away by the government authorities. Moreover, by shopping at these places, a person can save his precious time. There is no need to hop from one shop to another in search for their preferred thing. As many people face shortage of time, the time saved can be used for more value added activities. In conclusion, large shopping malls have made shopping convenient and hassle free by stocking all the items under one roof and eliminating parking woes. Hence, in my opinion, their advent is a positive development.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.  ",8,False,77.02122240129836,303
"An overwhelming number of people work for long hours which leaves them with very little time for recreational activities. In my opinion, this has lots of drawbacks when compared to any minor benefits it might bring. Admittedly, if people work for long hours, it helps in their career progression as well as job prospects. In other words, since we have fierce competition in the job market, hardworking is inevitable for one to rise through ranks. Another point to consider is that working hard aids in the acquisition of desired skill which is required for a person to prove themselves to be an asset to the company. Therefore, hard working employees are offered not only incentives such as travel allowance but also fringe benefits like housing allowance and free medical insurance. Despite the advantages mentioned above, I believe that instead of allocating some time for leisure activities if a person works for prolonged time, it affects them negatively. Firstly, constant work can result in burnout and affect our mental wellbeing. It is undeniable that people need to unwind from stress to become more productive. Secondly, people can turn their hobbies into useful skills. For instance, some interests such as photography or art offer a creative outlet. Finally, working hard will affect a person’s work/life balance and, therefore, blur the boundaries between personal and professional life. People would find it difficult to wind down at home as they work so hard. In conclusion, owing to the fact that recreational activities as well as free time are of paramount importance in a person’s life, negative impacts of people working hard for long time far outweighs any of the benefits it might bring.

"While some people argue that it is better to do online courses than regular courses, others insist that regular class room courses are more beneficial. In my opinion, online courses are way more advantageous than offline ones as they are more interactive, and can be accessed anytime from anywhere.  One the one hand, many people support the idea that online courses are better as they deliver the course content in a very interesting and interactive way, which makes learning more effective. Online study material and lectures provide the information in the form of video with graphical representations making it easy to understand and retain the concepts and vital information. Moreover, both recorded and live sessions of online courses can be accessed at the click of a single button through devices like personal computers, laptops and smart phones. For Instance, teachers from Delhi are teaching mathematics to students in London through live sessions available 24 hours. On the other hand, it is also believed by some that offline courses are better since they give an opportunity to a student to interact with a teacher face to face and thus establish a direct connection between them. It helps a teacher to deliver the lecture in the best possible way and help the student to perform well in his/her subject / course. Another reason why offline courses are considered better is that the student can learn from their fellow students which makes learning more practical and illustrative.  However, offline programmes tend to be more expensive than online programmes. Also, in order to attend a regular course, a student has to be physically present in the classroom. This is not possible for people who have a full time job. Online programmes, by contrast, can be accessed at a time convenient to the learner.  To conclude, there are many persuasive ideas in support of both the arguments but it is my strong conviction that online courses are far better than offline courses because students can learn more effectively through digital interactive sessions at the click of a single button while sitting at home.

"According to some people, youngsters should be motivated to leave their home and live on their own when they become adults. However, others believe that young people should stay with their families as long as possible. I personally opine that it is a wise decision to leave home at the beginning of one’s career, provided that one does not have any dependent family members. Now, I will discuss both the views in upcoming paragraphs. Encouraging young people to leave their homes and be on their own is definitely a common trend seen nowadays and there are various reasons to support this argument. First, better job opportunities are available when people move to cities or other countries. This, therefore, helps in their career development and broadens their career prospects. Second, people become independent in addition to being confident and mature, when they leave their homes and live at far places. For example, now they learn to take decisions on their own, both personally and professionally, considering their growth and goals . On the other hand, living with families has its own advantages which cannot be overlooked. First, people can remain under the guidance of their parents and elder members of house and develop qualities like respect, caring attitude towards them. This consequently helps them to stay connected to the roots of our culture and values. For example, studies have shown that adults who live in their families are more emotionally attached to them as compared to ones who live at distant places. Second, they can provide mental and emotional support to their parents whenever they need it. However, in my opinion, although it is necessary for an individual to be career-orientated and independent in this competitive world, it should not be at the expense of your family and if  they are  dependent on you, it is better to stay with them and find an alternative to grow professionally and financially in your hometown.  To conclude, there are certainly benefits to leaving home and being on one’s own. However, if your family is dependent on you, it is better to stay with them so that you can take better care of your needs.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Although it is believed by some that acquiring a university degree is essential for securing a dignified job, others feel that taking up any work and gaining experience is a better alternative. I reckon that education is crucial for honing different skills and attaining success in future.  On the one hand, some people believe that instead of going to university one should take up whatever job available and gain hands-on work experience. For example, it takes at least 3 years to acquire a university degree. An industrious person can use that time to work and gain valuable experience. This career strategy will be a boon in certain domains where practical knowhow is essential like carpentry, masonry etc.  Thus we can see why certain people are of the view that getting into work early has an upper hand over gaining university degree. On the other hand, acquiring a university degree is considered by some people as the assured way to get a good job as graduates are well prepared with the skills and knowledge required for working in any field. For instance, an MBA degree holder is always the first one to be considered for a managerial post even if the company has other experienced employees. This is due to a simple fact that the university degree is considered to be a benchmark for securing a good post in any firm. Hence, it is clear why some people believe that a degree weighs more than experience because the future prospects become minimal without a good qualification in the resume. In conclusion, despite the fact that people have different views, I believe that academic degree is more beneficial than work experience in obtaining a desired job as without a degree the career prospects will be stagnant after a point.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

A better regulative approach is required  traffic accidents can be reduced. Some people say that changing the drivers’ age limits is the best solution to the problem. However, there are other, more practical ways to deal with this problem.One alternative is imposing heavier fines  the drivers who exceed the permitted alcohol consumption. According to recent , a great proportion of traffic accidents has alcohol as its reason. Utilising technology and installing devices that detect drunk drivers and lock car ignition can be used to keep people with track record of drunk driving off the roads. On some occasions and for repeat offenders in particular, a prison sentence may also be considered.Furthermore, people should be better educated and more careful while behind the wheel. To be more specific, people should learn to obey road rules and respect the other drivers instead of causing tension or submitting to road rage. In addition, heavy fines should also be levied for exceeded speed limits. Last but not least, safer and wider roads should be constructed to make for easier and more comfortable driving.Tightening age limits for drivers can be a complementary approach. For example, the elderly with vision problems or other important health issues should be excluded from driving. Besides, young people under 18 years old are considered immature to drive. However, maturity does not necessarily always increases with one’s age, which is why other measures are needed  dangerous driving.In conclusion, I believe that stronger measures should be implemented for the prevention of traffic accidents, and drivers should have a more responsible attitude. Setting age limits could be helpful but should not be considered the optimal and only solution to the problem.",8,False,89.47923085387325,311
"Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your experience.Write at least 250 wordsSome argue that dieting has an extraordinary impact on one’s life, whereas others are of a view that it absolutely adversely affects a person’s health. It cannot be denied that dieting taken to extremes may cause more harm than good, however, in my opinion effective dieting is pivotal for maintaining good health and keeping a more attractive body shape.First of all, the possibility of increasing level of physical health lies with incorporating proper dieting in our lives. It is reasonable to suggest that dieting is effective for controlling our body weight within an ideal range in order to achieve the normal score of body mass index (BMI), which is essential for preventing us from  overweight or obese. As a result, the risk of suffering an  illness will be reduced. A recent research concluded that dieting is one of the most effective measures to cut down one’s body weight among the obese group, and it helps to improve their medical condition indirectly.Moreover, dieting is crucial for keeping ideal body features regardless of gender and age. A fit and presentable body outlook absolutely boosts up one’s  level in his or her social life, not to mention professions that require keeping one’s body in an attractive physical shape. For example, dieting is adopted as a popular way for reducing weight among actors and actresses. A recent article reported that an actress who successfully regained her slim body after a period of dieting was offered an excellent job opportunity in the Hollywood film industry.In conclusion, dieting has a positive influence on one’s life in terms of maintaining a profound level of health and keeping a more attractive body outlook.",8,False,91.77464788732395,288
"With the proliferation of high-tech media, some people  that the public libraries would be rendered obsolete if they  not offer software, videos or DVDs to their users while  assert it’s only a waste of limited resources and the libraries should offer books only.High-tech media is, in many ways, indeed superior to the books in terms of entertainment, attraction, and functionality. For instance, videos and DVDs function as a visual means to assist people to have a first-hand experience even though those people have not physically visited or seen the objects which are introduced in the books. Also, despite  audio-visual equipment would be prohibitive to install, the capital cost would be lowered by appealing to a sizable number of users.More importantly, software could assist the library goers to access the Internet to update their knowledge on a daily basis; in contrast, books typically take multiple months to be published, which in turn  their contents outdated to some extent. In addition, upon learning that the computer literacy has become an essential skill recently, public libraries should take on the responsibility to educate  users how to operate a computer.Furthermore, it is a common practice for most public libraries to share their resources via the Internet. In this way, even if one book of interest cannot be found in one library, the borrower still could locate the book  other libraries and then request the librarians to transfer the book to that particular library.In conclusion, public libraries would benefit in multiple ways if they  equipped with the high-tech media.",8,False,84.66666666666667,254
"It is often thought by some that large companies and industries will benefit more if they move from urban centers to rural areas. In my opinion, the advantages that the companies and the public receive from this outweigh any disadvantages. The primary benefit for companies shifting from highly populated city centers to less populated rural areas is that they get enough space for the disposal of their waste. By doing so, air, water and noise pollution caused by large scale industries can be reduced. Also, industrial wastes can be properly disposed of without disturbing the environmental equilibrium. In addition, with the development of factories and other enterprises in remote areas, local people get a plethora of job opportunities which eventually lead to poverty eradication. A recent study by the University of Mumbai found that 80% of employers in the countryside prefer employees from the local areas and this has made a drastic change in rural people’s living standards over the last four years. Admittedly, there are some disadvantages to companies moving from city centers to suburbs. As transportation facilities and availability of resources and raw materials are less in these regional areas, production may be affected at some stages. Obviously, this paves the way for loss of revenue during the initial stages. Furthermore, the consumer base may not be as large as that in cities and towns which may even cause economic crisis to some industries at certain stages of development.  In conclusion, industries and companies in rural areas help entrepreneurs to flourish their business without threatening the environment. This would also benefit many people with employment opportunities. Hence, I think minor loss of revenue during the initial phase of shifting to regional areas is not significant when compared with the advantages.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Every life on this planet is important. Many people believe that using animals for the purpose of experiments is cruel; however, others hold the opinion that for the progress of science it is required. To a great extent, I agree with the argument that doing research on animals is an act of exploitation and we do not have any right to do so. Misusing the life of innocent animals is not right at all. In our due course of experiments, several animals suffer and even get killed because the tests are done to identify the impacts, which can be positive or negative. For instance, it is found that animals that undergo severe test fall ill because of the dosage of the chemicals which the body cannot resist. As a result, animals suffer severe physical and mental disorders because we are not aware of the consequences of such drugs and their usage. However, others hold the opinion that for the development of science, these kinds of experiments are highly necessary. It is true that science has greatly helped mankind from severe diseases which were incurable before. With the invention of medicine and various drugs, today we are able to save millions of lives from death and illness. It is found that modern medicine has improved the life span of the human race and is indeed a big success. But still, seeing the tragedy and sufferings of the innocent animals, I believe that it is injustice and we do not have any right to torture these animals for our own interest. Every life on this planet has got equal rights and freedom to live which no one has the liberty to interfere with. In conclusion, there is no doubt that science has done miracles in improving the lives of human beings but experiments on animals for research is highly unacceptable and therefore is very wrong.

"It is widely acknowledged that cultural events play an indispensable role in some individual’s life. In order to attend those events some people spend a huge amount of money on tickets. In my opinion, this kind of activity is definitely a good practice. One good reason for this is that such cultural and sporting events help many individuals to get away from vicious things like work pressure and stress. In other words, in this modern developing world, people are busy with their hectic work schedules and are completely occupied with work targets and project deadlines. The only medium for some individuals to escape the stress and pressure are sports and cultural programmes. This is particularly true in the developing and developed nations. Furthermore, there are many proven medical examples where cultural events worked as a therapy for many health issues. Another point to consider is that by attending these events individuals learn to respect different cultures and sports around the globe. For example, when people travel to another country to attend a cultural event, they automatically start to love and respect the culture and some of them may even adopt it. Additionally, this helps to form healthy relations between two different categories. Finally, in this 21st century tourism industry is one of major sources of income for many countries. Among various factors cultural and sports festivals are the major ones to encourage tourism. Major sporting events like Olympics or World Cup generate billions of dollars in revenue and also create tens of thousands of jobs. Obviously, such events give a major boost to world economy. To conclude, I believe that people spending money to attend cultural and sporting events is a positive development, especially in this developing world. This not only helps the individual but also enables to form a well-rounded society. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Advertisements play a major role in influencing the buying decisions of customers. Over the years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of ads targeting children because advertisers are aware that kids are the centre of nuclear families. Most of these ads are aired in the evenings when children are back from school and sitting in front of the television. Some people opine that commercials targeting young kids should be banned. I agree with this view to a great extent because in my opinion excessively promotional ads have a devastating effect on children. First of all, children are easily manipulated by the adverts which take them to the virtual world and coax them to purchase products that are not always worth their money. For instance, toys of the Star Wars series are very popular among teenagers and sales of these toys are very high in the market. Secondly, the advertisements are delivered in such a way that children start pestering their parents to buy those products. The fast food chain McDonald’s employs this strategy. Their ads attract more and more teenagers to eat fast food which is not good for health because it contains high levels of fats and cholesterol which cause obesity and diabetes in children. Another reason to restrict ads is that they may even put the lives of children at risk. Children often imitate the dangerous stunts performed by celebrities in commercials and often lose their life or cause themselves serious injuries because they are not aware of the consequences. On the other hand, not all ads are bad. Actually, some of them promote good habits in children. For example, some ads encourage children to brush their teeth twice a day and wash their hands frequently. Such ads develop healthy habits in children and hence they should be aired during prime time. To summarize, most ads targeting children are overly promotional and have a negative impact on children. Hence the government must ensure that they are not aired during prime time. However, ads promoting good habits and social commitment must be shown in the evenings when most children are in front of the television. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Most of the nations across the globe promote tourism. In my opinion, the advantages tourism can have on a nation’s economy and development are greater than any disadvantages. The primary benefit of encouraging tourism is that it is a profitable source of income for many countries. In other words, tourists provide a plethora of opportunities for the natives and the nation to earn money. Because of this rising demand for tourism, many youngsters are employed in different sectors which circuitously assist to reduce the unemployment rate in many countries. Thus, a nation with lower unemployment and higher sources of income will lift their laurel beyond imagination Similarly, to attract more foreigners to the country, the government and the public will make efforts to improve the infrastructure of cities and towns. Furthermore, they become more concerned about retaining the natural resources and conserving the countryside as most visitors enjoy visiting and appreciating the beauty of the countryside. Therefore, it is obvious that encouraging tourism apparently paves the way to protect the environment and its resources from many threats. Despite the above-mentioned advantages, I admit that there are some disadvantages to promoting tourism. One such issue is the chances of spreading of any communicable disease. Fortunately, health sectors are now developed in such a way that medical tests and health checkups are done appropriately to ensure the safety of the locals and the tourists from any contagious diseases. Hence, such concerns do not hold much water. In conclusion, undoubtedly, tourism plays an integral part in escalating a nation’s revenue and it indirectly helps in the development and protection of the rural and urban areas. Therefore, I think that the demerits are negligible compared to the merits. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The widespread use of technology has made it possible for the people to advertise the charity programmes that can reach masses within a short period of time. In my perspective, it is completely a positive development; however, the chance of fraud in some cases cannot be overlooked.  In the fast paced world, people spend most of their leisure time watching television or browsing the internet. The use of social media applications has increased tremendously. It is a platform for various non profit organisations as well as the families who are in need of immediate funds to advertise themselves. Furthermore, they can convey their message, share the bank details for general public to donate some funds. As a result, they can pay off huge expenses such as hospital bills or education fee. To cite an example, on Facebook we can see a lot of posts where family members ask for some donations to help them overcome a cash crunch. When affluent people see such kind of advertisements, they immediately provide a helping hand directly to the people in need rather than contacting intermediaries.  However, on the flip side, some individuals may take undue advantage of the donors. They exaggerate their pathetic conditions and make such advertisements as their source of income. Nevertheless, television and the internet is a common platform where masses come together and most of them donate for a global cause.  To conclude, charities are advertising themselves on television and the internet because of the massive reach of these platforms.

Some people opine that success in sports is determined by the muscular strength of the player; others insist that mental strength is more important for performing well on field. In my opinion, physical stamina is more important than mental agility. On the one hand, mental strength is certainly important while playing a game. Players should be able to focus and they should never lose sight of their goal. Likewise, they must be able to play without losing their heart when the opposition performs better during the match. If they lose heart and become dejected it will further affect their performance and that will cause them to lose the game. On the other hand, muscle strength is even more important. Physical sport is not a mind game and as such there is not much that a player can achieve by simply being mentally strong. Sportspersons who perform on field require tremendous physical strength and stamina. For example, in football a player should be able to perform for 90 minutes or more at a stretch. They have to run, jump, attack and defend and all of these activities are performed by the body. Without a strong body, they cannot continue playing. Of course, mental stability will help them stay focused without feeling dejected; however, having focus alone is not sufficient to win the game. In conclusion, players need both physical and mental powers to win a game; however, in athletic events, physical strength is a lot more important than mental ability because success in such sports depend entirely on a player’s ability to play tirelessly for the entire duration of the game.",9,False,73.13018378887841,281

However, some parents say schools  on teaching more academic subjects, such as mathematics, science, literature and history.

"It is true that these days people are spending / expending a bigger proportion of their money on beauty care than ever before. Although there are some negative consequences to this, men and women can take certain steps to mitigate the potential problems caused by this. There are several reasons behind this. For example, people want to look like celebrities and gain more popularity among their social circle so they invest in cosmetics. Over the last two decades, the digital innovation has led to the creation of highly influential channels like Facebook, Instagram. Consequently, people have too much exposure to film and sports stars and want to copy their looks. Advertising companies are taking advantage of the digital revolution and make popular faces as a brand ambassador to promote their product. They pay exorbitant amounts of money to celebrities with the objective of attracting more buyers. People use multiple personal care products for grooming themselves in order to look like a cinema star. There is a general perception that good looking faces will turn heads and get praised and this makes men and women wanting to look better. Discrimination between good looking and non-good looking is yet another reason that people spend money on grooming products. Beautiful people get attention everywhere and this encourages everyone to want to look good. To protect young people from such negative influences it is essential to teach them to accept themselves the way they are. It is also essential to inform people that the perfect look of celebrities is not real and is actually a result of using excessive makeup and filters.  In addition, natural looks should be promoted everywhere and everyone should learn to accept others irrespective of their flaws.  In conclusion, in order to look more like celebs and get complimented people today spend a lot of money for personal care products and this can be reduced by creating general awareness and promoting natural beauty.

"There is no denying the fact that the government has to take care of several pressing issues such as poverty, unemployment and illiteracy. This is particularly true in the case of developing countries. However, this does not mean that the government should not spend money on arts. Art represents a country and its heritage. Take, for instance, the case of India. The country is famous for its exquisitely sculpted monuments, temples and palaces. They were the handiwork of artists of the bygone era. Even today, the temples and monuments at Konark, Rajasthan and Madurai attract tens of thousands of local and international tourists. They showcase the rich cultural history of the country and elevate its status. If the kings of those times had not patronised art and artists we would not have these monuments to show off now. Not only the monuments but other forms of art like dance and music also need to be preserved for future generations. Otherwise, we will lose touch with our roots.  Government funding is crucial for the existence of arts. Art itself does not generate much revenue and hence artists, especially the lesser-known ones, have to struggle to make a living. This deters many of them from pursuing art as a profession. The only way to kindle their passion is to provide them financial assistance. By doing so, the government can not only protect its artists from starvation but also preserve his cultural legacy. Spending money on arts is also a way of generating money and creating employment. For example, if the government conducts art festivals and exhibitions, they will attract a lot of visitors and return the investment. Such events also provide employment to a number of people. Thus, it is evident that spending on arts is not a waste of resources.  To conclude, it is important for the government to invest in various social and economic welfare schemes. Likewise, it is equally important to invest in arts.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit It below in the comments for a free band score estimate. ",9,False,67.86513157894737,345
"Education plays a crucial role in the development of a country and its people. Of late, there is a sharp rise in the number of youngsters studying at university. While some people argue that it is a positive trend because it raises the educational standard of the general populace, others opine that it could dilute the quality of education. In my opinion, when more and more students go to university, it is definitely a positive development; however, it does have some downsides. The most significant benefit of this development is that it produces highly educated and skilled workforce. Graduates and postgraduates learn crucial job skills at university and once they graduate, they are ready to immediately join the workforce. Skilled workers enhance the productivity of the organisation they work for and earn good remuneration. They also contribute to the development of the country by paying taxes. In addition, an educated populace is more aware of their rights and responsibilities and makes valuable contributions to their country. On the downside, when too many youngsters join universities, the quality of education may suffer. One of the main causes of this problem is the resource crunch. University education is expensive and many universities lack the right infrastructure or adequate resources to cater to the needs of all students that join them. As a result, they will be forced to increase the strength of classes which in turn will prevent students from getting adequate individual attention. Underequipped laboratories and libraries also reduce the quality of education. Unemployment is another issue that could arise when there is an increase in the number of graduates. If the governments or industries do not create enough job opportunities then there could be an issue of unemployment and people may start looking for other options like migration to rich countries for work. Unemployment may even increase the crime rate in the society.  To conclude, when more students receive university education, it is usually a positive development; however, the government should closely monitor the functioning of universities and ensure that they have sufficient resources to cater to the needs of the growing number of students.

"Travelling and exploring places has always been a desire of humans. It is believed by a certain section of the society that in the coming years people will tend to choose their home country over international destinations. I completely disagree with this notion and believe that international tourism will flourish due to numerous reasons which will be discussed further in this essay.  To begin with, people with disposable income do not mind spending money on a foreign location. In other words, most of these tourists prefer to choose vacation spots which are far away from their countryside. Just like people living in the plains want to visit the mountains and beaches, those from the colder countries prefer to visit warmer regions and vice-versa. For instance, according to a recent survey conducted by the Tourism industry, countries like Thailand and Indonesia attract more than seventy per cent of the tourists from all over the world. Thus, it helps the countries to boost their economy, and at the same time, it helps the tourists to explore the international destinations.  Secondly, many people travel to explore and discover the cultural heritage of other countries. To add on, people travel to gain awareness of new customs, cultures, cuisines, people and places. This not only broadens their horizons but also teaches them various aspects of that place. For example, according to a recent survey conducted by a travel magazine, almost thirty per cent of the people travel to learn the cultural differences of places and explore different cuisines. For these reasons, people will continue to travel abroad and enjoy the charm of those exotic places. To conclude, the tourism industry is currently hit by many flying restrictions; however, it will rise back to its glorious heights once the world recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic. I believe that holiday-goers will continue to explore and discover different locales and will not be constrained to traveling within their native places.",8,False,74.09070667086502,322
"Many individuals now tend to migrate to urban areas rather than staying in rural areas. The main reason for this migration is to find jobs. While this migration can benefit them eventually, there are also some problems involved. Those living in the countryside mostly depend on natural resources such as cattle and farmlands for their survival. Many farmers are totally dependent on agricultural lands. Unfortunately, uncertain rains, snowfalls and cyclones damage the entire crops in such a way that farmers end up in ultimate frustration and commit suicide. This is why, nowadays, many people move to cities to look for a job, which gives them at least a fixed source of income. However, moving to cities does not always prove beneficial to many people. The decision to search for a job is money driven and most people cannot easily adjust to the life in the city. Secondly, they have to struggle for their basic needs and also for the education of their kids. Finally, the hectic lifestyle and pollution in cities affect their health. Since many of the rural people lack skills, they may end up getting a low paying job and this could make them even more depressed. To overcome this problem, more practical solutions are required. For instance, a co-operative dairy can be opened so that farmers keeping / raising cattle can sell milk to dairy and can earn a second income. Small scale industries such as textiles, sugar or oil industry which runs on agricultural products can also prove effective. The government can provide funding to such industries and the products can be made available at a subsidised cost for farmers.  In conclusion, I would say those living in the agricultural background should try alternative income sources as migrating to a city can add to their problems.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is debatable whether free speech is an absolute must or not. In my opinion, it should definitely be protected because it is crucial for the progress and wellbeing of the society; however, there are certain situations where it needs to be reined.  Like every other form of freedom, freedom of speech is not absolute. No one should have the right to say whatever they want regardless of the consequences. Words are like weapons. They can hurt if they are not wielded carefully. For example, if someone ridicules another for being born with a certain disability it can have a very damaging effect on the victim. Thus, in my opinion, people with disability should be protected from a personal attack wrapped in the name of free speech. Furthermore, any forms of bullying should not be tolerated. Whether it is verbal or physical, no one should suffer when another person exercises their freedom of speech. For instance, nowadays it is popular among web-users to ‘troll’ someone online. This act of ridiculing others on the web is popularly called trolling and it is very toxic. Trolling has even led to suicides. Therefore, freedom of speech should have its limits and law should be drafted to protect people from its misuse. On the other hand, freedom of speech and expression is crucial for the healthy functioning of the society. The freedom to express opinions is crucial for a civilized society to correct its course for a better tomorrow. Regardless of how controversial an issue is, people should have the freedom to express themselves and be heard of. This is one way for the government to assess public sentiment and take actions for a brighter future. Hence, free speech is not only beneficial but also mandatory for a society to progress. Without it, authorities will have full control over the people and progress will not be made. In conclusion, free speech should have its limitations and no one should be allowed to hurt another person by mouthing whatever they feel like. At the same time, it should be protected and encouraged because in a free society everyone has the right to be heard. ",9,False,62.14703237410072,359
"The previous century witnessed a significant growth in human population. However, despite the increasing number of people, they avoid personal communications and do not know the names of the people next door. Many social and technological developments have caused this trend and, in my essay, I will cover two of them and propose possible ways to encourage neighbours to communicate with each other. To begin with, people change their place of living more frequently than they did in the past. Today, many people, especially the young generation, tend to move from one town to another in pursuit of / in search of education or better job opportunities. As a result, they do not have enough time to build relationship with people living around. Students studying overseas are a good example of this. They spend a few years in a certain place and then return to their hometown or relocate to a bigger city where they can find a better job. International students usually are not able to build a strong connection with locals and have a solitary lifestyle. Secondly, some prefer to avoid any personal physical contacts and spend more time on social media or on the phone chatting with friends. Unfortunately, there are more people who have over two hundred friends on Facebook and still they do not have an idea about who lives in the next apartment. There is no single strategy that we can use to make people talk to their neighbours and only a multilevel approach can change the situation. Firstly, the government should support local community events. Small festivals attract families and young people and give them an opportunity to connect with members of the community. For instance, in Auckland, every suburb has a cultural festival where the public not only learn about different cultures and try international food but also has a chance to get acquainted to their neighbors. Secondly, locals should organize community groups which can support new arrivals, have regular meetings and activities such as art or foreign language classes. Lastly and more importantly, every individual should demonstrate a curiosity about people living around and be more friendly to neighboors. For example, we can start saying “good morning” to each person we meet on the way to our work. In conclusion, frequent relocations of people and the high usage of the internet are real obstacles to develop contacts with people around. However, with government and community support and a personal will to interact with neighours, we can break these communication barriers and build meaningful relations with our neighours.

"International travel allows people to gain a deeper understanding of foreign countries and cultures. It is also argued that it contributes positively to an individual’s way of thinking. I agree with the argument that people who travel overseas are more likely to be tolerant and cooperative. To begin with, people of different nationalities have their own traditions, beliefs and behaviours. If an individual decides to go abroad for a short-time, they may encounter many challenges during their visit such as language, food and local culture. This experience helps to broaden their horizons and their mindset. Studies have shown that a person is more likely to improve his level of tolerance and understanding of cultures and people when they travel abroad. Therefore, international travel is often seen as an important life experience. Another point is that individuals who have visited international destinations tend to change their view about social problems in their own country. For example, it is noticeable that many countries face the problem of racism in certain ways. However, if people had some experience travelling abroad, they are more likely to accept and respect race, beliefs and cultures. Moreover, they try to imitate certain behaviours in order to feel more comfortable themselves when interacting with local people. By contrast, if a society is less tolerant and less understanding, the community as a whole will not overcome their social problems. In conclusion, having the opportunities to meet and interact with people of different cultures has an impact on the way people think about their own traditions. It helps to rethink and open the mind to embrace more of the values and traditions of their own country.",7,False,76.07570950870274,276
"Switching jobs has become more frequent in modern days than in the past because people become dissatisfied and bored with the current job within a few years. Even though there are both benefits and drawbacks to this phenomenon, this essay states that it has more of a positive impact on the individual and the society. Currently people have various job opportunities and they often look for new careers as most of them are unhappy with the present position after staying in the same job for several years. Therefore, people get bored of their routine and believe they can perform better if they switch jobs. To illustrate, a recent research carried out by the Labor Department of United States sated that 80% of working citizens are not satisfied with their job and an average person changes his/her career every five years. The change in the career pathway will always benefit the individual and the society too. The change in jobs exposes people to various experiences, new technologies and different working cultures and thus they gain a wide range of knowledge and experience.  As a result, they become more motivated and energized to accept new responsibilities at work and finally it is an advantage for their personal development. Furthermore, this trend will merit the society in the long run because when a society consists of an energetic and satisfied work-force which has a better work-life balance, eventually the country will develop not only economically but also socially. For example, in a survey carried out among the employed population who had a recent change in occupation, 60% of them stated that they were happy with the new placement. To recapitulate, the trend of changing career / changing jobs is more popular in the present because many people are not content and get bored with the current job after performing the same responsibilities for some years and this phenomenon will positively benefit both the person and the society too.

"There are lots of youngsters who work part time while they are still at school.  Working part-time early on helps students to gain real world experiences but this also prevent them from getting involved in various extra-curricular activities at school. This essay explores the advantages and disadvantages of working part time. Working while in high school offers various advantages to the students. They gain real world experiences very early on and learn how to manage the time between work and school, which is a very important skill to master for future successes. The exposure to the workplace helps them build their character and discover their strengths. Working outside gives them an opportunity to meet with various people and handle difficult circumstances. On the flip side, there are an equal number of disadvantages to working part time. Working part time means students have to manage both work and studies. This may hurt their focus and affect their performance. For example, they might have an important exam at school and a stressful situation at work simultaneously. In such situations it becomes very hard to concentrate on either of them. By contrast, a student who does not work part time is more likely to do better in their exam. Students who work also regularly miss out on various extra-curricular activities or playtime with friends. These can impact social bonding with their peers. To conclude, working while studying definitely has advantages that help students to succeed in life; however, these children also miss out on a lot of activities that their peers engage in. It is recommended that children should understand both sides of the situation before choosing to work while they are still at school. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Unpaid community service such as working for a philanthropic organization or helping old people must be an integral part of high school education. The schools are not a place for learning math or physics only. They should teach real life skills also. Therefore I strongly believe that unpaid community services should be added to school programs. Children who go to high school should learn to help old people without expecting anything in return. In my opinion, everyone needs to learn to help others without expecting anything in return. This might be difficult in the beginning, but they will learn this skill over time. For example, teaching sports to younger children or helping old people will become interesting activities for them after they see the other person’s happiness. By engaging in these activities from such a young age, they will learn to take care of people who need their help. For example, if they become an engineer, they will readily help an engineering student in internship. Working for a charity also gives students an opportunity to communicate with other people. This will improve their communication skills. Good communication skills are essential for success in life. For instance, by working for a charity, they start to communicate with people that they don’t know. This situation improves their communication skills. The other important point is that they will be a part of a group and learn to work in a group. In conclusion, unpaid community service must be an important part of high school education and I strongly believe that these services must be compulsory and with these services, students learn crucial life skills in their early life.",7,False,53.81057268722467,275
"Nowadays, many places across the globe are economically dependent on the tourism industry. However, there are some drawbacks because of the recreation activities especially as they cause some damage to the nature. Even so I think it has brought more advantages than disadvantages and we can discuss this in detail in this essay. Firstly, tourists create more jobs for the native people; as a result, it significantly increases the standard of living by a huge margin. Secondly, travellers spend more money on their adventure activities, shopping and accommodations during their travel. This in turn brings increased revenue and plays a tremendous role in the country’s economy. In addition, tour operators), tourist guides and resort owners will benefit and their lifestyle also changes. Directly and indirectly, tourism brings more advantages to the country. Nevertheless, some say that the tourism industry exploits the natural resources and brings unwanted pollution. There is always an increase in the number of visitors at attractive sites such as falls and scenic beaches. Due to this, the garbage and traffic pollution are inevitable. Furthermore, some people intentionally drink alcohol in the park and beaches which causes inconvenience to other visitors and cause damages to the breathtaking views. However, these things can be avoided by bringing many strict rules and measures. To conclude, tourism certainly has some negative impacts on the environment; however, its advantages far outweigh the disadvantages because it creates jobs and improves the living standards of people; as for the disadvantages, strict laws will take care of them.

"Traditional cultural symbols are increasingly being used to boost local tourism. Some people support this move as they believe that their local cultures can be perpetuated in this way; however, other people argue that making money from cultural traditions will eventually destroy their indigenous culture. In my opinion, culture based tourism protects rather than destroy traditional cultures and values. Integrating traditional cultural aspects with local tourism provides greater exposure to these cultures. To be specific, by showcasing indigenous activities, handcrafts and artworks in front of international travellers, local residents are actually putting their own cultures under the spotlight of the whole world. This will help spread their culture all over the world and more and more people will be interested in visiting those holiday destinations which are famous for the exotic cultural experiences they provide. This will not only boost local culture and traditions but also help local artists and artisan earn a better livelihood. For example, this is a great way to promote local art and dance forms that may be losing popularity among the native audience. On the other hand, over exploitation of cultural traditions for the sake of tourism may inevitably cause issues. If the local culture is coarsely adapted to suit the purpose of tourism, the tourist experience is compromised and this may actually show the culture in a bad light. For example, when I was travelling in Yunnan Province in the Southwest China, I took part in a culture experience tour so as to know more about the local culture. However, the tour was poorly designed and all participants were made to buy local handicrafts. It left a negative impression on me and I will not recommend this place to any of my friends. In other words, for many destinations, the merging / amalgamation of culture and tourism is doing more harm than good.  In conclusion, there is no harm in using culture to promote tourism. It not only enhances the reputation of the country but also provides a livelihood to local artists. However, it is essential to do this in an aesthetical manner so that the effect is not counter-productive.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some people believe that friends have more impact on teenagers than their guardians or mentors. I agree with the assertion because friends spend more time together and there is no generation gap between them. The primary reason for better understanding between friends is the amount of time they spend together. For example, on average two teenagers spend around eight hours in the school and four hours playing together. So, it is natural for a person to be influenced by the other persons with whom he spends most of his time. Peer pressure is another factor that encourages teenagers to copy their friends. Therefore, the friends have more impact in the life of a juvenile than their parents. The second reason for this might be the generation gap. For example, a study conducted by the Harvard University found that music interest plays an important role in the development of bonding among teenagers. However, due to generation gap often parents and their children have different tastes in music. This is another reason for them to enjoy the company of their friends more. Additionally, it is observed that children are reluctant to share their private stuff with their parents. As a result, parents do not get enough opportunities to influence their children. In conclusion, though many people think that parents and teachers have a greater impact on a child, I disagree with this statement. The main reasons are that young people spend minimum time with their parents and there is a generation gap between them.",8,False,78.78649453823238,252
"Owing to the rising unemployment and increasing cost of university education, it is considered by many people that subjects, such as philosophy and history, should be excluded from the curriculum and in order to increase job prospects, only practical subjects should be taught. In my opinion, even though practical subjects increase the chances of employment, art subjects have their own importance in contributing to the growth of an individual and the society/nation. Arts subjects are crucial for the growth of the individual. This is primarily because many individuals are passionate about studying these subjects. By studying them, people are able to understand the human behaviour. As a result, they would know the causes behind the unethical behaviour of the humans. This would enable them to be creative and come up with the innovative ideas to avoid such behaviour and make the world a better place to live in. Thus, these subjects would enhance the thinking ability of the individuals. However, diminishing employment opportunities and increased university fees have made professional courses more viable options.  By teaching practical subjects, such as accountancy and law, job prospects would increase for an individual. This is mainly because employers prefer a candidate fully equipped with the practical knowledge. For instance, multinational companies shortlist only those candidates who can prepare the financial statements which require accountancy skills. Once people find jobs, the unemployment rate comes down and the nation progresses. It is apparent / obvious that the demand for practical/professional courses is at an all time high. To conclude, practical subjects, no doubt, increase job opportunities for the people and help them with their daily needs. Art subjects, however, are also crucial for the development of the individual and the society. Hence, in my opinion, universities should offer both types of courses.

"Knowledge increases when it is shared and hence some people believe that scientific, technical and business information should be shared freely; however, others opine that it is better to keep some information confidential. In my opinion, both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. We live in an age where new inventions happen almost every single day. Sharing this information is important because it helps to keep us updated with the inventions happening around us. Also, these researches can be used to develop technologies that can be used by people to ease their lives and for the betterment of the society. For instance, the invention of stem cells therapy pushed the boundaries of medical science. By using stem cells in laboratories we can create any organ we want! This regeneration helps us to avoid the danger of donor organ rejection. Sharing such useful inventions helps the students to be up to date with the recent procedures and thus become much better professionals. On the other hand, sharing too much information can be dangerous. For example, research related to weapons and nuclear science is extremely sensitive and confidential. If it is fallen into wrong hands it can lead to wars and terrorist activity. Likewise, some information regarding business finances and the algorithm is kept confidential by companies to stay ahead of the competition. Sharing this information may incur major financial loss for the company and loss of its USP / competitive edge. To conclude, my opinion is a neutral one. It is extremely important for the world to share knowledge regarding science and business but it is equally crucial to safeguard the information that is sensitive to companies and the country.

"Until what age individuals should work is a debatable issue; it is argued by many people that individuals should stop working once they reach the age of retirement. This essay strongly supports this view and it will examine this in subsequent paragraphs. To commence with, on average, an individual works for almost twenty-five to thirty years before his or her retirement. This time span is quite long enough and by the time they reach the age of 55 or 60 most of them have already worked hard and fulfilled their responsibilities like providing education to their children and saving enough for their retirement. Therefore, after retirement individuals need time for themselves to enjoy their life. They should spend this time for travelling to new places and also in physical activities like Yoga and Meditation that can improve their health. To illustrate further, according to a recent survey by World Health Organization, people who retire at the age of sixty and do not work after that were 30% happier than those who continue to work after retirement. Furthermore, after retirement individuals can involve themselves in taking care of their grandchildren and being a mentor to them. Senior citizens possess a vast amount of life experience and it can be utilised best when they share it with youngsters; they can guide them in achieving their life goals. For instance, in our society, we have a club of retired people who help youngsters by guiding them to take the right decisions for their future. To conclude, once individuals reach the age of retirement they have worked enough and they should spend the rest of their lives doing activities that make them happy. Moreover, they can help youngsters in achieving their life goals. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"It is true that there has been a rise in the number of people who get married and have babies in their mid 30s and beyond. In my opinion, this is a beneficial practice because at this age most parents are financially stable and emotionally mature to raise their children properly and ensure a better future for them.  Most men and women do not earn well during the initial phase of their career. Hence, if young people get married in their 20’s and start a family immediately afterwards, they are more likely to run into financial difficulties. As a result, they will not be able to provide the best healthcare or education to their babies. This inability can actually make them feel inadequate and even affect their emotional wellbeing. This, in turn, will seriously affect the upbringing they can provide to their children. If parents are unhappy about their life and finances, they will never be able to raise happy kids.  By contrast, most adults in their 30’s already have a well-paying job. They are also mature enough to nurture a family. Consequently, when people get married and have babies at this age, they are fully prepared to deal with the challenges that come along with parenthood. For example, they are able to not only send their children to the best schools but also deal with their temper tantrums more patiently. This may not be possible for a 20-something father or mother who barely earns enough to put food on the table. Obviously, when people marry in their 30’s it benefits them as well as their children.  To conclude, financial stability and emotional maturity are vital for being a good parent; since young people in their 20’s may lack one or both of them, I feel that waiting until they are in their 30’s to get married is a good idea.

From my standpoint, it  more beneficial if both the country’s authorities and individuals  the responsibility.On the one hand, the government may play a pivotal role in maintaining the environment safe and healthy. It is  that should introduce the legislation in order to mitigate environmental problems, such as air pollution and more.

Cars are considered to be a major source of air pollution. Their exhaust gases contaminate the air, ranging from carbon dioxide to unburnt carbon. Therefore, by using their own vehicles only in rare cases, people would be able to protect the environment. Another opportunity available to individuals is recycling.

"Criminals are a threat to our society and it is a matter of concern that the crime rate has increased dramatically in many countries. In this essay, I will discuss some of the reasons behind this and propose solutions to combat the problem. First of all, the main reason behind the surge in crime is poverty as most of the people in developing countries are daily wagers, and they have to struggle everyday for their bread. Therefore, out of hunger, some people start committing petty thefts at shops and cars, and over time some of them become gangsters. A study conducted by a University in Denmark revealed that the children growing up in poverty are seven times more likely to be involved in violent crimes when they become young adults. Another cause is the over-ambitious nature of some individuals. These individuals keep an eye on others’ wealth, and sometimes they become so desperate that they start blackmailing rich people, and even kidnap their closed ones for ransom. To tackle this problem, the first and foremost step is to enforce law and order. In other words, the government should impose strict rules and regulations by recruiting incorruptible law enforcement authorities especially in criminal zones to turn them into safer region. For example, the US has a crime-rate of only 2% as compared to Somalia, whose crime-rate is 50% due to strict implementation of rules by the former. Secondly, the authorities should expand employment opportunities for the poor so that every individual could at least earn their living and live their life in a better way. Consequently, the poor would not be compelled to do misdeeds to fulfill their basic necessities. In conclusion, although the problem of crime is not insurmountable, I believe that it is the government’s responsibility to solve these issues, and they should begin by considering some of the solutions proposed above.

"Nowadays, many hold the view that because of the land shortage in metropolises, more residential buildings should be constructed in the countryside. Others insist that protecting the countryside from excessive exploitation is even more important. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the debate before arriving at a conclusion. To begin with, there is no doubt that due to the growth of city population and the migration of rural people into urban areas, metropolises such as Beijing and Shanghai are facing the situation of residential land scarcity. In addition, the high demand for residential buildings somehow contributes to the rise of housing price in big cities. Therefore, developing the countryside seems to be urgent. Not only can it provide people with more affordable housing, but the rural area can also benefit from the development of better infrastructure. On the other hand, the importance of maintaining farmland / agricultural land in the countryside cannot be neglected. If excessive amount of arable land is used for residential purposes, there will be a severely negative impact on food production and supply. Moreover, farmers could be deprived of the land they live upon and this may cause social instability in the long run. To summarize, there is no doubt that there is indeed an urgent need for building homes in the countryside. At the same time, excessive development will have a detrimental influence upon the entire human race. In the final analysis, to tackle the problem of housing shortage governments should develop the countryside in a responsible way and ensure that adequate amount of land is reserved for farming.

"Sports play a vital role in developing many personality traits as well as social and moral values. For this reason, many people think that to foster these qualities in students, sports should be made an integrated part of college curriculum. However, in my opinion, sports should have no place in college programmes since it is a waste of time as well as money.  College is a place where students come to study academic subjects. They need the help and guidance of proficient teachers to comprehend and interpret difficult topics. Thus, the responsibility of teachers and college authorities is to expend their resources to upgrade teaching tools and to develop new teaching strategies rather than wasting those funds on sports’ coaches, instruments and the construction of big stadiums. After all, the objective of educational institutions is to help students achieve academic excellence. Having said that, the students who have aptitude for sports can hone their skills by joining an institution that provides dedicated training in this field. These training institutions are designed with the sole purpose of sports education. Moreover, they hire trained teachers who can help students diagnose their weaknesses and strengths. Meanwhile, the college can devote this time for studies and vocational training that would give students practical knowledge in their field. This knowledge will help students to achieve excellence in their vocation and earn lucrative jobs. To conclude, it is irrefutable that sports are of paramount importance in students’ lives, but providing training in it is not the responsibility of college. Instead, educational organizations should focus more on academics by utilizing its resources for educational purpose rather than physical education.    Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to some people, the purpose of schooling is to prepare students for higher education at university. In their opinion, school is not the right place to learn skills required for the workplace. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, schools should definitely impart theoretical knowledge in the core subjects; however, at the same time, the school curriculum should include activities and assignments that enable students to acquire practical skills required for the workplace. It is important for schools to teach subjects like science, mathematics and languages to their students. While these subjects do not necessarily prepare a person for a job, they are essential for surviving in this world. Language skills, for example, enable students to articulate their thoughts more effectively. Likewise, some understanding of science and mathematics is crucial for going about our day to day life. Hence, it is imperative that schools provide education in these subjects. In fact, every student should learn to read and write and do simple sums before they acquire work skills. Also, most prestigious jobs require a person to have a tremendous understanding of theory. For example, one cannot be a doctor or an engineer without learning theory. And before students can enter a medical college or engineering college, they should have learned the respective subjects at school. Hence, the argument that schools should prepare students for university certainly holds water. On the flip side, schools can certainly set aside a few hours for teaching practical skills that enhance a student’s job readiness. Not everyone will become a scientist or a doctor. The world needs carpenters, plumbers, masons and cooks as well and interested students should be able to acquire basic skills in these occupations at school. This does not mean that these skills should be taught at the expense of the core subjects. However, there is no harm in setting aside a few hours every week for imparting work skills that might be beneficial in the future.  To conclude, school is certainly the place where students should acquire knowledge required for university. However, this does not mean that schools should only teach languages or mathematics. Some training can and should be imparted in work oriented skills as well.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Celebrities and famous personalities are often the center of attraction and have the potential to influence young minds. While some people think that most celebrities are famous just for their wealth and glamour, and that they negatively influence our younger generation, I disagree with this view. In my opinion, although some celebrities try to achieve name and fame through short cut, not all of them are in the limelight for superficial things like money or glamour. It cannot be denied that certain celebrities adopt quick methods to become famous. For example, certain film stars wear glamorous or revealing dresses either in their movies or during social gatherings to grab attention. Some also flaunt their ancestral money. These tactics can bring them lots of attention. Such celebrities may come across as a bad role model for young people. However, fortunately, often name and fame achieved through such means is short lasting. Most of them disappear from the limelight in the blink of an eye. Conversely, not all celebrities are alike. Many of them put in years of hard work and face long lasting struggle to reach their current status.  For instance, many movie artists and social activists are world famous for their struggles and resultant achievement. The example of the youngest Nobel Prize winner Ms. Malala, can illustrate it extremely well. She has spent many years working for the protection and empowerment of women and children. She was once fatally attacked by militants but she did not give up. She is now an inspiration of millions of women across the world. Hence, there are many famous personalities who have become famous due to years of strenuous work and their achievement. Such celebrities also act as good role models for our society. They encourage young minds to focus on working for the betterment of themselves and the society. To conclude, in my perspective, although a certain number of celebrities become famous using superficial ways, a large number of world renowned people come to limelight due to their work and achievement. And such famous people can inspire our younger generation in a positive manner.",8,False,92.59474613520672,351
"It is often argued that the health conditions of a person will gradually degrade in the coming years. I tend to agree with this statement, because people are majorly relying on outside food and our air is too polluted for us to breathe it. Due to the increase in competition between various sections of the society, most people are under tremendous job pressure and can hardly take out time to cook food at home. Moreover, with easy access to various online food ordering options, many people like to order unhealthy and oily food as per their choice and this could adversely affect their health. For example, the famous home delivery option, Pizza Hut is open 24 hours and promises to deliver food in just 30 minutes. Such facilities attract the working population. Even if people decide to cook at home, the fruits and vegetables sold in the markets are laced with pesticides. As a result, many people are prone to developing health issues such as obesity and high cholesterol level. Environmental degradation is another factor that affects the health of people. Our environment is seriously polluted by the emission of poisonous gases from factories or from vehicles. Hence, the air we breathe is highly polluted and can affect various parts of the body, because, in the process of breathing contaminated oxygen is supplied to all organs of the human body, exposing them to serious organ failures. For example, according to a recent study conducted in India by expert environmentalists, 70% of the population has traces of carbon monoxide in their body, which can lead to several serious breathing ailments. To conclude, it is rightly said that in the coming years, most people will not be able to sustain an average healthy life. As explained above the reasons for this could be pollution and unhealthy lifestyle of people.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Although international tourism is one of the largest booming industries, some people consider this detrimental to host nations. The main reason for this is cultural differences and to remedy this problem, a collaborative effort of the individual individual and the government is required. To begin with, the difference in cultural and traditional values of the countries is the most crucial factor responsible for the opposition towards foreign tourism. Many countries such as India, Pakistan, and Arabia have traditional cultures and they provide immense importance to their cultural values and beliefs. For this reason, they often expect tourists to follow the same and any violation leads to conflicts. To illustrate, recently in Mumbai, two foreign tourists faced criticism of locals and they were not allowed to enter the Sidhi temple as they were not wearing the traditional attire. Thus, the damage that foreign visitors can cause to ethnic values makes the people oppose their entry. To combat this issue a collective effort is needed. Primarily, tourists should be encouraged to learn and understand the cultural and traditional norms of a country before visiting it. It is imperative that visitors respect the culture of the host countries and act according to them. Also, local people should treat the visitors as their guests and guide them appropriately when they violate the norms instead of criticizing them. Secondly, the authorities and tourist associations should also provide the complete guidelines to the visitors in the form of brochures, websites or templates.  In conclusion, despite the surge in the rate of tourism, it is not considered a good trend by some people owing the conflicts it can cause between tourists and locals. To change this perspective, tourists should respect foreign cultures and customs when they are abroad and the governments of host nations must also take appropriate actions to make tourists comfortable.

"Illegal drugs have become a worldwide problem in modern day society. The trading of drugs is widespread in nearly all countries and the number of people consuming drugs worldwide is high. It has been suggested simply to legalise all recreational drugs to solve the problems associated with them. I personally agree partially with this proposal, because I can see many advantages, yet also many disadvantages.One positive aspect of legalising these drugs would be that the number of criminal activities committed to obtain them would decrease. Fewer people would therefore be imprisoned and have a criminal history that prevents them from progressing in life. Additionally, essential police resources would be freed up and devoted to other areas. Finally, high taxes could be imposed on the legal product, allowing governments to have better resources to improve the infrastructure of their countries.Although legalising all illegal drugs could result in several positive effects, there are many negative effects that could be possible. As a result of the legalisation, I personally believe that it would become acceptable to use drugs and people would no longer pay attention to the damage that drugs cause. Schools might no longer educate teenagers and adolescents about the negative effects drugs have on people, resulting in more teenagers experimenting with them, as they would believe that this is a normal aspect of life. This would result in a higher number of drug addicts and potentially in more deaths, because it would be easier to obtain a large amount of illegal drugs and therefore the chances of overdosing would also increase.In conclusion, I partially agree with the proposed action. Nonetheless, I think that an age restriction should be placed on drug use, as teenagers and adolescents could easily become addicted if all illegal drugs are legalised. This group of people is highly at risk of becoming addicted and potentially dying as a result of drug use and therefore should only be allowed to consume drugs after reaching a certain age.",9,False,66.4291177748805,329
"It is a common belief that higher studies provide better jobs. However, some people opine that university education offers more benefits than improved career prospects. This essay will discuss both the views in detail. On the one hand, education provides knowledge and wisdom. Knowledge in turn boosts one’s self confidence which reflects in one’s personality. It also develops sound understanding of the subject. All of these are instrumental and crucial to acquire a suitable job. Moreover, in today’s competitive world only the best will win. Hence a person lacking proper qualification and sufficient knowledge will lose the race and lag behind. A recent study by ‘Education Forum’ magazine suggests that the service sector recruited 75% graduates and 25% undergraduates the last year. This in itself shows how important higher education is to acquire a good job.  On the other hand, education not only benefits one’s career but also changes their outlook towards life and society. Knowledge helps to develop strong reasoning and analytical skills. This empowers people with the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, good and bad. Educated people refrain themselves from blindly following any superstitious beliefs. One educated person can educate the entire family and their surroundings. Moreover, knowledge develops moral values of people and makes them responsible citizens. For instance, if we look back at history the great Raja Rammohun Roy and Vidyasagar struggled hard to eradicate social evils like SuttidahaPratha, child marriage etcetera. And they were all well qualified people who fought against such social norms which were very common those days.  To conclude, I am of the opinion that University education has a larger role to play than just provide good jobs to people.",8,False,156.40813731722824,278
"Securing admission in institutes of higher learning is often dependent on the merits and academic abilities of the student. Some argue that all students should have the opportunity to study in universities irrespective of their knowledge and skills. I disagree with this argument and believe that admission should be merit based. To begin with, the most sought after academic courses often have limited seats, and hence all applicants cannot be admitted. This is not surprising, though. Unlike schools which admit all students, universities are for specialized learning. Therefore, universities use certain selection criteria such as academic qualifications and other skills to decide whether a student is eligible for admission. This will, of course, mean that only the meritorious can secure admission. For instance, a recent survey in ‘The Hindu’ revealed that in India only 10% of those applying for engineering courses are able to secure a place for themselves. Another reason not to admit all students is that university programmes require students to demonstrate a certain level of intellectual capacity. Not everybody can become a doctor or a scientist even if seats are available. Moreover, a student who is not capable of learning a specific subject will not benefit from joining it. For example, a student who has no aptitude for medicine or engineering will not benefit from joining a medical college or engineering college. If they do, they will not be able to learn the concepts or put them into practice. This will be a sheer wastage of valuable resources. Hence it is evident that if a student joins a course which he is not capable of comprehending, it will benefit neither him nor the society. To conclude, in my opinion, admission to universities should be based on the academic credentials of the students. Only then will our universities be able to produce high achievers who can contribute something to the society.",9,False,66.20714315954706,312
"In many countries, the governments are razing down old structures to build new structures in their place. While some people believe that old buildings are an integral part of a city’s skyline, I agree with the argument that they should be demolished to make way for new world-class buildings. There are ample reasons to state that old buildings should be removed from a city. Firstly, they are often dangerous and unsafe for their inhabitants and the surroundings. Due to their dilapidated conditions such structures are an eye-sore and require a lot of maintenance. However, if they are razed down, the area can be further developed into world-class buildings which are more in-sync with current times. Secondly, the new buildings can be converted into multi-level offices, malls or even houses making the area more livable for its citizens. Moreover, in today’s time when space has become a luxury in most countries, such positive changes can bring a sense of relief to the citizens. What’s more, the money spent on maintaining old structures can be better utilized for developing other kinds of infrastructure. Of course, some people argue that old buildings represent a city’s rich past and razing them down will result in the end of an era. In their opinion, these buildings can be converted into museums or the like. However, in my opinion, it is not possible to convert all old buildings into museums or heritage sites. After all, most of our cities already have enough museums. To encapsulate, I strongly assert that old buildings and structures should make way for new buildings with better infrastructure for the development of a city and a country.",8,False,81.07371004094261,275
"Some people argue that building more sporting facilities is the most effective way to improve public health; however, others argue that playing a sport or building more sports clubs alone is not sufficient. According to them, other measures are required to ensure public health. I do admit that sports are beneficial for health, but in my opinion people also need to follow a healthy diet and a healthy lifestyle.  Beyond doubt, there are several benefits to indulging in sporting activities. Most of the outdoor and indoor sports require physical effort and this in turn makes a person active and flexible. This definitely helps to better the physical body. To illustrate, a person indulging in regular sports is bound to be fitter than a person who does not participate in any major physical activities or sports. In addition to that, playing a sport benefits the mental health and keeps a person agile and active in their thinking. Thus, we can see why some people are of the view that playing sports is the most ideal way to attain balanced health.  However, playing a sport alone is not sufficient. It is also important for people to watch their diet. If they follow a nutritious diet and play a sport regularly, they have very good chances of maintaining good health. For example, no matter how much sport we play it is not going to be that effective until we follow a proper diet and exercise regime. Exercise helps the body to gain the agility and lose extra calories and a balanced diet makes sure that the amount of supplements required to the body is supplied in an efficient way and the body does not put on the extra calories and fat. Therefore, it is clear why people consider measures like exercise and balanced diet more effective than merely playing sport to attain good health.    To conclude, people might vary in their opinion but I firmly advocate that playing a sport alone will not be that effective in improving the fitness level of a person. In addition to playing, people should exercise regularly and eat a balanced diet. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Every four years, the whole world stops to watch international sporting events such as the Olympics and the Football World Cup in which athletes show their best performance to make their country proud. These sporting occasions have proved to be helpful in easing international tension in difficult times when powerful leaders were trying to control the world’s economy and other governments were fighting over the land.The Olympic Games are one of the best examples which prove how sporting events can bring nations together, at least temporarily. From the ancient History, when Greeks and Romans would interrupt battles to participate in the games, to the more recent international disputes, when athletes from Palestine and Israel would forget their differences, compete peacefully and even embrace each other after an event. Moreover, these popular events have called the world’s attention to the terrible consequences of wars; thus some leaders have tried to reach agreements to end their disputes and live peacefully.Similarly, international sporting events show benefits in some developing countries which live in a daily internal civil war. For example, Brazil has a high rate of unemployment, lack of education, hunger, crime, poverty and corruption which leads to an immense embarrassment of being Brazilian and a low self-esteem. However, when the Football World Cup starts, the Brazilian squad, which is considered the best team in the world, provokes an amazing feeling of pride in their country. Most people seem to forget all their problems and even the criminal activity decreases. They paint roads with the national colors, wear the Brazilian team shirts and buy national flags. Moreover, the competition brings families and neighbors together and even rival gangs watch the games and celebrate peacefully.In conclusion, popular sporting events play an important role in decreasing international tensions and liberating patriotic feelings as history has shown.",8,False,100.33333333333333,301
"Nowadays celebrities make more money compared to people working in politics. This essay will look at the possible causes of this tendency and explain why, in my opinion, this is a negative development.There are two main reasons why celebrities generate more income than politicians. One of them is that with the advent of the Internet, there are more ways available for celebrities to earn money, such as online streaming services. For example, singing a song in a YouTube video with some advertisements enables them to easily make a few million dollars. Another cogent reason for this is the growing global concerns over excessively high remuneration for political leaders, which can easily lead to public discontent. In response to such criticism, many governments have decided to reform the reward system for lawmakers, sending their salaries on a downward trend.I personally believe that this development is relatively negative for several reasons, with the main one being the potential corruption scandals this issue can create. The enormous salary gap between celebrities and political leaders might discourage the legislators from putting in work or even motivate them to commit crimes such as money laundering. In addition, the relatively low salary for stressful jobs of governors may deter people with foresight on politics from becoming politicians. This is particularly undesirable because it would result in low level of citizens’ loyalty to their incompetent government, creating unstable society with more crime and other social problems.In conclusion, the fact that celebrities are paid more than political leaders now is caused by a wider variety of income sources available to them, and supported by the social norm that a politician should not be a profit driven professional. However, I believe this is a negative trend which may lead to more political corruption and less talented governments.",8,False,108.24989023051592,298
"Discuss both views and give your opinion. Many people consider that awarding a longer sentence to a criminal will lessen the crime rate. However, some people think that there could be other efficient ways to reduce crime. In my opinion, it is always better to keep psychologically unstable criminals behind the bars. However, those guilty people who reflect on their mistakes should be treated differently. Firstly, all the criminals should be regularly examined by a psychologist to understand their mental behaviour. The criminals with a tendency to commit repeated crimes should get a life long sentence. These people are a threat to the society and even to themselves, as they are bound to commit the crime again, if released early. For instance, I recently read in the news that a rapist, who was released early, committed the same crime again within 24 hours of the release. However, a few people who commit crimes by mistake, and realize their wrong doing, should be given an opportunity to reform themselves. There are many ways to punish people for their crime, depending on the severity of the crime. For example, community service could be one of the options, which has widely been used in western countries, as punishment for various crimes. Moreover, making guilty people work towards the betterment of the mankind is better for the society as well as for the person. In the end, I would strongly say that the criminals with a  negative criminal history and an unstable mind frame should be held longer in the prison. But at the same time, people who commit minor crimes and possess good behaviour should be penalized in different ways, so that they can live a respectful life later and give something back to the community.

"According to some people, income tax should be abolished and no one should have to pay any taxes to the state. I completely disagree with this notion and believe taxation is extremely crucial for the country’s development and helps in building an equitable society. If people paid no taxes, the government would not have any treasury. Consequently, the government will not be able to build roads, rails, bridges, dams, schools and hospitals. In this scenario, even the basic necessities will have to be provided by private organizations making them expensive and unaffordable to the poor. As the government will not have any say in the administration of the country, it is hard to believe that there will be any steps taken for its development.  Another reason why I disagree with the idea of no taxation is that it would create inequality in society. The money will not be circulated through the system and as a result, the wealthy will become wealthier. The concentration of much of the wealth in the hands of a few will indirectly mean that the larger population will be exploited by a few. This will lead to the establishment of a capitalist society, removing any chances of equality and injustice. Overall, the poorer sections of the community will suffer the most and the upper class will have all the luxuries and comforts because of their money power. To conclude, taxation is crucial for ensuring the equitable distribution of wealth. Hence, the idea of not paying taxes is dangerous because it will lead to the collapse of the nation by making the rich people richer and poor people poorer. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Shopping was considered as daily routine work in earlier times; however, recently it has become a leisure activity for some people. In my opinion, this trend has more negative impact on the public than positive. It is true that these days people have busy schedules and hence they go shopping with their family to spend some time together and buy clothes and other necessary things. The advent of malls has also played a role in making shopping a pastime activity. At the malls people can find all that they need under the same roof. They can also eat food and even watch movies or play games.  In fact, shopping became so convenient in the last decade that it is now a hobby. On the flip side / On the down side, due to availability of numerous products and increased comfort level in shopping centers, people tend to spend more money. For example, many people buy something which fascinates them even if it has no use in their lives. Because of credit availability, people do not have to pay the whole amount upfront. Unfortunately, this may land them in deep debts. In addition, youngsters spend a lot of time in shopping malls as they are influenced by the advertisements whereas, this time can be utilized wisely in sports. To conclude, I would like to say that although shopping is essential to some extent it has many negative impacts on individuals. Hence, people should go for shopping only when  it is necessary. Shopping should not be considered as a hobby as it could lead to some undesirable circumstances. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"It is true that there has been a rise in the number of people taking a yearlong break after completing school and before joining university. The main advantage of this trend is that it gives sufficient time for a teenager to learn new skills and the main drawback is that this can also be wastage of time if it is not planned carefully.  Taking a year off after the completion of school has several merits. To commence with, it gives an individual enough amount of time to concentrate on enhancing his skills. In addition, an adolescent can invest this time to prepare for engineering or medical entrance examinations which are difficult to clear without adequate preparation. For instance, as per recent research by Times, only 20% of the students who cleared the IIT exam in 2018 were freshers and the rest of the students were one-year droppers. Moreover, a student can master skills like communication, foreign languages and also learn sports such as cricket, tennis, football and several others in this one year.  On the flip side, the main disadvantage of this phenomenon is that if planning is not done properly then this can be just wastage of the time. Instead of taking a year gap after finishing school, a person can take admission in college and get a job after completing his college studies. As a result, this will save him one year and will also help him to gain hands-on work experience which is more vital than theoretical knowledge. For example, a recent study revealed that 60% of the students who took a year off before joining university had done nothing fruitful and thus it was a total waste of time. In conclusion, although the decision to take time off before enrolling into a college is good for those who are very serious about their career, proper planning is essential to avoid wastage of time.  There is no doubt that the trend of taking a year break after the completion of school and before starting the college courses has become more popular. In this write up, I will highlight the benefits and drawbacks of this new development / approach. To start with the positives, a significant advantage is that students can explore the possibilities and get prepared for the future assignments. For instance, during this time children can learn new languagues, or they can enrol in a course which can provide them the extra credits. As a result, the candidates will have an edge over their competition, and get admitted to the desired college. Moreover, teenagers nowadays are interested in travelling to other nations prior to commencing another phase of their life. This is because some of them might be interested in doing some voluntary work and others might find it refreshing to gain knowledge about the diverse cultures. However, taking an year off can have some disadvantages too, the most obvious one of which is the loss of track due to the long gap. For example, some students may fall into the trap of bad influence and they might start using drugs, alcohols ,and other harmful substances. This will definitely sabotage their future. Furthermore, youngsters may be diverted from their path, if they start earning their livelihood. Such an environment is likely to curtail their interest in further education. Children are the future of the nation, and such mishaps can affect the entire nation’s progress. In conclusion, although having a year  gap can broaden the horizons of the students by providing them a better vision of the society and various cultures, it can also deviate them from the right path and their jeopardize their future.

"To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Pollution and poverty are important causes of illnesses. Some people, therefore, feel that the governments should take measures to tackle these evils. I completely agree with this view. Many governments already earmark a considerable percentage of their annual budget to healthcare. If a fraction of that is spent on providing housing and improving air quality, the governments can prevent people from falling ill in the first place. Millions of people still live in unhygienic surroundings. They cannot afford a home because of poverty. Unhealthy surroundings are the breeding ground of bacteria, mosquitoes and flies. Since these are the carriers of illnesses people living in slums and poor surroundings fall ill quite often. If the government provides affordable housing to all, the living standards of millions of people in the developing countries will improve substantially. As a result, their health will also improve. Pollution is another silent killer. Due to environmental pollution the quality of air, water and soil has decreased causing various illnesses in people. For example, respiratory illnesses are quite common among people living in cities because of the poor quality of air in urban areas. Water pollution causes illnesses like typhoid, jaundice and dysentery. While these diseases can affect anyone, people living in dirty surroundings are more likely to be affected by them. To conclude, if the governments are really keen on improving the health of their citizens, they must address the real cause of diseases. In other words by simply making housing affordable for all and controlling air pollution, the government can protect its people from illnesses.

"The entertainment industry is increasingly becoming popular around the world and usage of new technology in this field has changed it a lot. I do not agree with the argument that the use of technology will reduce the creativity of the people. I will prove my stand with valid arguments in this essay.  First and foremost, people are becoming more creative by applying technology in a leisure industry like cinema. They can put their ideas and imagination in movies through different software and devices. To illustrate, the famous Hollywood movie “Avtar” depicts the creative thinking of the writer which cannot be executed without the use of new technology. Hence, application of new types of software, web designing, and graphics helps us to become more creative and execute our creative ideas more efficiently.  In addition to this, theme parks, kids game zones, and art galleries are using different tech-related equipment and devices to enhance the creative ability of the youth. There are various art galleries which conduct digital painting events for visitors to showcase and discover their creative talent. Kids zones are converting games and sports into a digitalized form which otherwise required rare and expensive equipment. These games can be played on a computer desktop to learn and enhance creativity among children which was not possible before. According to research conducted by Harvard university due to the availability of technologically innovative games in various parks, children are now familiar with a lot more games than in the past. So, it helps to increase the learning and creative ability of children. In conclusion, after analysing the situation it is not hard to see that application of technology in the leisure industry has enhanced the creativity and artistic ability among people around the world.    Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Nowadays, many youngsters tend to move from rural areas to urban areas leaving behind elderly people. This essay will explore the problems associated with this trend and propose measures which might address them. One of the problems that might occur as a result of young people moving to cities is that cities might become overcrowded. Population explosion puts a lot of pressure on the city’s infrastructure, which, in turn, might inflate the property prices. Having said that, one of the main reasons why youngsters move to urban areas is that cities offer lucrative employment opportunities compared to the countryside. So, to tackle overpopulation in cities, governments ought to provide better employment opportunities in rural areas by subsidizing the operational and infrastructural expenses for private companies. This, in turn, would encourage businesses to establish their companies in these areas. Another problem that might arise when youngsters leave their old parents behind is that the latter lose their support system when they need it the most. Generally, old people need assistance from others even to perform their day to day activities. If all the young people move away from them, there will be no one to support them. This, in turn, may push them into depression.  This problem can be mitigated if youngsters try to find a means of living with the resources available in the countryside. They ought to make the most of what is available in these areas and stay back with their parents as family comes before everything. The government can help them by encouraging industries to set up their offices in rural areas.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Awarding prison sentences has long been regarded as an effective method to fight crime. I agree with the argument / view / opinion that it can be a good approach, although we should also consider other useful correctional methods.    Imprisonment can considerably reduce crime in society, because such a punishment has deterrent effects on offenders. Being sentenced to prison means that people lose freedom they are entitled to as a law-abiding person. They are not able to keep in touch with their loved ones, including family and friends, so they tend to feel lonely and isolated in prison. Since most people cannot bear this consequence of breaking the law, they are less likely to commit crimes.  While it is true that this harsh penalty is effective at curbing crime, there are even better approaches such as community service. Unlike prison sentences, the community service can rehabilitate minor offenders by isolating them from possible negative influence that they could be exposed to in jail. Hence, drunk drivers or shop lifters will not have opportunities to befriend serious criminals. Instead, they will constantly receive education through various rehabilitation programs to realize how their behaviors have caused problems to communities, and this will encourage them to reform themselves. Another benefit of the community service sentence is that it can help many people, especially young offenders, to get reintegrated into the society. The major reason for junior delinquency in many parts of the world is poverty, which is a result of the lack of education in these areas. Because these deprived children have not received education that teaches them how to distinguish right from wrong, they are likely to commit crimes. If they engage in lectures and events organized by governments, they can understand moral principles and improve their skills, helping them find employment when they enter society.  In conclusion, while imprisonment is a good way to control crime rates in society, community services can also work as an effective reform method. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Dieting seems to be  of our life in this modern society, especially for those who are health conscious. Different people choose different type of dieting methods, trying to achieve what they believe to be good for either their health or physical appearance. In general, most of the people who diet are focusing on controlling their weight.In our urban society, most of the working class  not have the opportunity to consume . Their daily meals consist of fast food which contains large amounts of fat and salt. The most significant  of this unhealthy lifestyle is the weight gain especially among those middle age working professionals. Therefore, most of these young and energetic people have to control their diet in order to stay in shape either for their appearance or health. The most common and proper method of maintaining one’s weight is eating less oily food, preferably more green vegetables, fruits and  alcohol.However, some have resorted to losing weight by taking their diet to the extreme, not eating at all for days. Others will make themselves vomit after each meal. Many others will go for dieting medication and beverages that help them to lose their appetite. These unhealthy  will cause internal damage in the long run.In my opinion, dieting for better health is more important than solely for looking attractive. Individuals who wish to control their weight should seek professional  if they are unable to reduce their weight after switching over to a healthy diet for a period of time. Losing weight and losing your health at the same time does not benefit any individual.",6,False,87.33333333333333,262
"It is thought by some people that the amount of traffic and pollution can be decreased by having the government impose higher tax on petrol. However, I believe that the advantages of using this approach are meager compared to the disadvantages. The long term goal of tackling traffic and pollution can be achieved only by reducing the need to use private transport.  A quick solution to limit the problem of traffic and pollution is believed to be a rise in tax on petrol.  This method creates a financial burden on the users of vehicles forcing them to reduce the usage of petrol. Consequently, it results in a significant drop in the traffic on roads thereby lowering the pollution levels. However, this method has a number of repercussions and it cannot be used for a longer duration. An increase in the tax on petrol has numerous drawbacks even though it is a quick way to lower the pollution. Initially, people may prefer to reduce the use of vehicles but later on, they adjust their finances to accommodate the rise in tax. The end result will be the same amount of traffic along with a financial burden on citizens. Another disadvantage would be an unhealthy relationship between the government and citizens. Additionally, the standard of living is also affected as people have to compromise on other commodities to save money for fuel. On the flip side, there are better ways to reduce traffic and pollution. One of them is to create awareness. The other is to improve the reliability of public transport. If people can take buses and trains and still reach their office on time, they are less likely to drive their own vehicles to work. To conclude, the disadvantages related to a rise in the tax on petrol outweigh the advantages. Instead of forcibly trying to curb the traffic, the government can use alternatives like creating awareness among the people about the ill-effects of pollution. Secondly, people can be provided other means of transport by enhancing the frequency and reliability of public transport. Lastly, the government can provide incentives for reducing the usage of vehicles.  If you have written an essay on this topic, post it below in the comments. You will receive a band score estimate.

"In the present age, a number of well-known players are doing different types of product advertisements. In this essay, we will throw some light on the advantages and disadvantages of this trend. Let’s begin by looking into the merits of endorsements by sportspersons. Firstly, players can promote certain products in a better way because they themselves use some of these items in their line of work. Sachin Tendulkar, for example, does the advertisement of an energy drink which he consumes while playing the game. Because of this reason, his endorsement of the product sounds genuine. Secondly, players can make money by doing various types of advertisements. In general, advertisement companies give approximately 25-50 lakhs to the players who work for them. This is a great opportunity for them to convert their popularity and brand value into money. On the other hand, there are some downsides to these celebrity endorsements. Primarily, this could take away the players’ focus from the game. To elucidate, last year, Virat Kohli, a renowned Indian cricketer, was not able to perform as expected in Asian Cup. Some people assert that this happened because he was featured in myriads of advertisements at that time which took his concentration away from the match. Furthermore, athletes could become money minded if they do a lot of advertisement campaigns. The result of this could be devastating for the players and ruin their game play. What’s more, sometimes players endorse poor quality products just because they are offered truckloads of money. In my opinion, this is a misuse of the trust their admirers have placed in them.  In conclusion, there is no doubt that popular players are advertising several products and this phenomenon has some obvious drawbacks and benefits which are given in the above paragraphs. All in all, it is up to the players to decide whether or not they should do these types of advertisements. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"You should spend about 40 minutes on this essay writing task and write at least 250 words. Nowadays, home-working has becoming very popular. Recent reports state that the number of people who work from home has grown sharply. Although it seems that this kind of activity only brings benefits, it may also bring some major drawbacks. In this essay, I will express the main advantages and disadvantages of working from home. Firstly, the crucial advantage connected with working from home is the fact that you can manage your own time. When people work from home, they are able to decide the best time to accomplish their work tasks and optimize their daily schedules, in order to solve other personal life problems.  By doing this, the worker can execute his job with significant less pressure thereby bolstering his creativity and enhancing the product quality. On the other hand, home-working has some drawbacks. If the employee who works from home does not have a strong sense of discipline, he may easily get sidetracked from his tasks. All the freedom which comes along with home-working might cause the worker to lose attention, thereby slowing down all the work process, making it impossible to achieve all the required tasks within the deadline. Furthermore, working from home keeps you away from coworkers who could help you with your job and also share with you important work experience which would improve your professional growth. To summarize, working from home may provide several life benefits such as the ability to manage your own time and work without pressure. Nevertheless, home-working does have a few drawbacks like isolation from colleagues. Would you like to use our writing correction service?

"Over the last few decades, the population of the world has increased dramatically. Currently there are seven billion people on the planet and this number is projected to grow over the next few decades. This essay will discuss the problems caused by overpopulation such as overexploitation of natural resources and extinction of wild life. In my opinion, providing better sex education is the most effective way to reduce population growth. Overuse of natural resources is one of the major problems faced by many countries. As the population grows, so does the demand for natural resources. For instance, food, water and fossil fuels are being consumed at record rates, placing greater demands on producers and resources. In addition, overpopulation poses a threat to the existence of wild life. As the demand for land grows, natural habitats such as forests will be destroyed. To illustrate, according to recent data revealed by scientists, there is a direct link between the increase in the population of human beings and the decrease in the population of wildlife.  In short, the growing / increasing population directly affects us with problems such as overuse of natural resources and destruction of wild life. However, there are various solutions which can help us to eradicate these problems. Overpopulation is mainly contributed by causes such as lack of proper sex education. In developing and poor countries, most of the people do not receive sex education and are unaware of the consequences of overpopulation. In an effort to overcome this issue, awareness campaigns can be conducted in every corner of the country. The government should make sex education a mandatory subject in high school. For example, in highly populous countries like India, the government has introduced sex education lessons from 7th standard onwards in the school.  To conclude, overpopulation is a crisis that potentially creates problems such as overuse of natural resources and extinction of wild life. Despite this, there is a way to combat such issues by giving proper sex education particularly in schools. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Over the years, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of people who commit heinous crimes like murder or rape. Some people insist that criminals convicted of serious crimes should be given the capital punishment; others argue that putting them behind the bar for life is a better approach. I agree with the latter view because in my opinion, neither people nor judiciary has the right to take a person’s life. To start with, people who demand capital punishment are of the opinion that it will act as a deterrent and instill fear in the minds of potential offenders. However, studies conducted on this topic have shown that the severity of the punishment has nothing to do with its being a deterrent. Rather, it depends on how fast the criminal is booked and the sentence is pronounced. In many countries it takes years for the judiciary to pronounce the verdict. This delay in awarding the sentence encourages more people to commit crimes. Also the capital punishment simply eliminates the offender from this world. It does not give them an opportunity to reform themselves. Therefore, in my opinion, the death penalty is barbaric and should be done with. Instead, the law should prefer life imprisonment. Life in prison, on the other hand, may serve its purpose of reforming the offender by giving them an opportunity to reflect on their act and live in guilt. Each and Every one should be given second chance. We must not forget that when the law takes the life of a murderer, it is also stooping to the level of that convict. In conclusion, criminals should be quickly brought to book for their crimes but capital punishment is not an answer for this. Life Imprisonment not only punishes offenders but also gives them a second chance to reflect on their act and mend their ways. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Finding a good job is a herculean task in this challenging world. It is commonly believed that tertiary education is the best way to secure an ideal job. Although this view is supported by some, others have a strong counter-argument that gaining work experience is a better option. In my opinion, education and work experience are both equally important. It depends entirely upon the requirements of the job.  To commence with, it is globally accepted that a university degree is the key to great career opportunities. Some professions demand a set of skills that can only be gained by a detailed study of the subject in college. For example, to become a doctor, an engineer, an architect, and an advocate a university degree is a must in order to equip oneself with the comprehensive knowledge of the subject to cater to these professional requirements. Therefore, it is said that a certificate of tertiary education is extremely important to be in professions where high level skills and thorough knowledge are the first and foremost prerequisite. On the contrary, there are professions which focus on experience rather than the degree. Entrepreneurship is one of the best examples in this category. For example, one does not need a university degree to open a restaurant or a workshop. These careers are based on practical experiences rather than university education. For example, in India the extremely successful small scale business named Lijat Pappad is owned and run by a  group of women who neither pursued studies nor possessed any degrees. Thus, it is evident that in some sectors experience is more important than formal educational qualifications. To conclude, it is the nature of the job which requires whether education is more important than work experience. A university degree is a must in certain sectors whereas experience is more relevant in some other sectors.    Do you have an essay on this topic?

"One the one hand good education is a highly recommended skill in the developed countries, on the other hand  of many people in regions of poverty. But what makes education  key factor for the development of a country We must acknowledge that education is something that we all need. The differences are just what we learn. Mostly the limited educational horizons of poor and less educated people have more to deal with their personal situation than with problems of bigger effects on a country. Attending school is sometimes too expensive and it does not feed a family.Nevertheless there must be a reason for education.

"Nowadays more and more youngsters are moving from rural areas to urban areas in search of better jobs and lifestyle leaving their old parents behind. This essay will discuss the problems related to this move and will also suggest an appropriate solution. To begin with, youngsters are moving to urban areas in search of better education and job opportunities which they cannot find in rural areas.  In cities there are good universities which will give them better education and improved career prospects. Also, plenty of jobs are available in cities. This is the predominant reason young people prefer towns to villages. Unfortunately, this migration causes a lot of hardship to seniors who are left behind. They have no one to take care of them when they need support the most. Consequently, many aged people are now seeking admission in old age homes where they may or may not receive adequate care. This problem can be solved if governments create higher educational institutions and job opportunities in rural areas. As a result of this, more people will prefer to stay in their villages. The government should sign contracts with big companies for creating job opportunities in villages /rural areas. To sum up, old people play a crucial role in our society as their knowledge and experience can help a society grow and leaving them alone will lead to several problems. The government can tackle this problem by creating more opportunities for younger generation living in rural areas. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"These days, it seems that more people prefer to live independently than ever before in many parts of the world. Yet, there remains some disagreement as to whether the effects of living alone are positive or negative. While there are certainly valid arguments to the contrary, I personally believe that the drawbacks of living alone far outweigh its benefits. These drawbacks are twofold. A good reason to oppose the one person household is that this way of living has an adverse impact on human psychology. For example, a recent study revealed that this lifestyle is the main cause of stress because people who live alone often have no one to share their problems with. This has a detrimental impact on their emotional health and wellbeing. Furthermore, our lives have many occasions and events to be celebrated with loving family such as New Year, birthday and so on. A singleton misses these happy moments altogether increasing their risk of suffering from psychological problems. Worse still, they do not have anyone to take care of them when they fall ill. Another point to consider is that as the price of commodities and apartments are skyrocketing, someone who lives alone is bound to have too much financial burden on themselves. This, in turn, forces those people to work unbelievably hard as they cannot expect any financial backing from their family or relatives in most cases. In conclusion, I once again reaffirm my position that living alone has a negative impact on our psychological health and financial situation.",7,False,97.03062757580437,254
"Migration for work is a popular trend. While some people argue that it has a bad impact on children, others, however, think that that it is a positive development. I believe that people migrate for better future prospects and it is beneficial for their children. On the one hand, people migrate to foreign nations because they want to provide a better life for their family and children. Most of these people migrate from under-developed countries to developed nations. This is because most of these developed countries provide free education and medical services to families. To illustrate further, Canada provides free medical care and education to its people. Furthermore, once youngsters complete their education they have much better job opportunities than they could have in their home country. As a result, youngsters feel more secure and satisfied. On the other hand, others believe that migrating to a new country has a negative impact on children. To start with, they may find it harder to adjust to a new culture. Youngsters need time and friends to adjust to a new society and when they do not find friends, they feel isolated and many of them become the victim of depression. Moreover, a foreign language is another hurdle that they face. Many families who migrate from Asian countries to Europe are not fluent in a local language like English. Due to this, children feel insecure when they try to mingle with locals. For instance, according to a survey by Hindustan Times, 40 percent of Indian Punjabi youth finds themselves isolated In Ontario, Canada because they do not have good command over the English language. To conclude, although initially, youngsters find it difficult to adjust in a new culture once they learn the local language and start mingling with locals they find themselves in much secure position due to various facilities like better education and free medical services along with better job opportunities in future.

"In modern day society, it is essential for a child to be educated in order for him or her to have success later on in life. Children are typically educated in schools, which are run by the government. The government officials therefore decide what is taught to the children and what is not. Personally, I believe that it is better if governments are responsible for the subject matter covered in school and not the teachers.It is a common goal to supply all children with the same opportunities in life, meaning that the same core knowledge should be taught to all children to offer them the same benefits. Naturally, some children will be better at certain subjects than others and will therefore obtain a more detailed degree of knowledge, yet every child should be taught the same core knowledge. Education provides opportunities, because certain types of education will enable children to pursue certain careers later on in life.Supplying the same core knowledge is an essential concept, yet it has not been put into action in several countries. In Germany, for example, the syllabus taught depends on the region of the country. In certain regions, children attend school for thirteen years and in other regions for twelve years. This raises the question whether or not the children obtain the same degree of knowledge and that the children attending school for thirteen years are at an advantage compared to those attending school for twelve years. Already one can see that problems arise when the regional government decides upon the core knowledge taught to students. If teachers had a say in what knowledge should be taught to students, the subject matter would become even more complex. The core knowledge would not only vary from region to region, yet also from school to school, providing unfair advantages and disadvantages for certain students.In conclusion, the government of a country should decide upon what knowledge is taught in schools, as the situation would become too complex if all teachers were responsible for this aspect.",9,False,59.02103825136612,337
"An organised and a clean home and a neatly ordered workplace require diligent effort on one’s part, but this endeavour is worthwhile; neatly placed things at both places make life easier and also enable work to be done in a more efficient way. Undoubtedly, tidiness is one of the great virtues to possess. Keeping things well organized not only reflects the amount of respect one has for the belongings, but also makes life easier in varied ways. Clutter rattles the mind leading to stress and frustration, especially when the object we are looking for turns invisible when we need it desperately. Placing things at the designated spots makes life lot easier as there are remarkably reduced chances of losing or forgetting the things. As a result of this, anger and irritation can be averted. Another advantage of tidiness is the efficiency it imparts to the work being done. As the things required are at quick service, it precludes the time wasted in finding the equipment. Also, things when kept clean, evidently, have longer shelf life and thus reduce expenses. This management of time and finances is the reward of tidiness. Moreover, by avoiding the wastage of time by keeping things in the correct place it also helps to keep the mind focussed on work at hand and thus enable the achievement of task in an effortless manner. In addition to this, it becomes easier to delegate the work to another person when everything is meticulously arranged. Summarising the above said advantages of tidiness, I reiterate that keeping home and workplace organised makes life comfortable as it obviates undue stress and agitation along with saving time and, sometimes, finances too.

"It is important to find out which subjects a student should opt for the tertiary education. Some people believe that they should choose science-related majors for higher studies in order to procure a lucrative job, while others opine that there should be complete freedom for students to choose subjects of their own interest. In my opinion, it is essential to allow students to learn what they like because it reduces the failure rates.  On the one hand, there is no doubt that science courses are quintessential for earning a job after the completion of university education. The reason for this is that most of the sectors these days are computer oriented and the demand for science graduates is increasing with every passing day. To illustrate, with the surge in digitalisation in India, there is a 40% increase in the science-related jobs in comparison to other areas. Therefore, these subjects are preferred as they provide job assurance. On the other hand, providing liberty to the students to choose majors according to their interest can certainly lead to lower failure rates. This is because, grasping of the concepts of a subject of one’s own passion is generally easy, and this leads to comprehensive / thorough learning of the subject and provides the opportunity to achieve success in that particular field. To exemplify, Taylor Swift, a world-famous music director and singer, studied music as a major. Thus, in my opinion, people are more likely to succeed if they follow their interests. In conclusion, although science-based subjects provide more employment opportunities, in my perspective, the choice of subjects with respect to the interest and passion often leads to success.

"According to some people technological innovations have made people more sociable; however, others disagree with that view. In my opinion modern technology is making people more sociable but at the same time it hinders the face to face interaction among people. I will explain my view in this essay. On the one hand, it is an irrefutable fact that modern technology has shrunk our big planet earth into a small global village. Now it is possible for a person to contact his kith and kin who are sitting on the other side of the planet with the use of the internet and mobile phones or laptops on a regular basis. This frequent contact among family members and friends strengthens the bond. Moreover, with the advent of fast transport systems / services like metro trains, bullet trains and flights the distance and travel time has minimised and it is now possible for people to visit their relatives living in other countries or states more frequently. Obviously, technology has increased the interactions among people. On the other hand, sometimes, children and adults become so obsessed with technology that they avoid in-person interaction with their relatives and friends. Children become so engrossed with new gadgets that they avoid spending time with their parents and friends. What is more, with the advent of e-commerce and various other websites now people are able to buy commodities of daily need or pay their bills online and this again has limited the actual interaction among people. To conclude, I reiterate that modern technology has given people a platform to stay in touch with their loved ones but at the same time it has taken out face to face interactions from the equation.",8,False,84.25610948191593,284
"Mastering a foreign language is often challenging many people claim that one should spend time in the native country, where it is used. I completely disagree with the statement as I believe that it is not only impractical but also useless amidst the presence of numerous alternative learning resources.    Firstly, there are endless resources available nowadays which can help you develop command over your favourite dialect. For example, you can have coaching sessions online with expert faculty who are often native speakers. Alliance Francais, for instance, is a renowned French coaching centre where native French speakers teach the language while providing great exposure and favourable learning ambience. Such tuitions also allow students to find practice partners and even get insight into cultural patterns. When you can converse or learn with a native speaker in your own place, you do not have to travel to a foreign land for it.  Apart from this, one can always refer to the internet to learn and practice. It is quite economic and great for those who can’t afford expensive coaching. The internet has united the whole world with a digital string. Keen learners can use YouTube where expert teachers voluntarily offer live classes or simulation lessons that are detailed and informative. In addition to rich videos, some websites post informative blogs, practice exercises, FAQs, etc. regularly that are great for aspirants.        Since you do not have to travel to a coaching centre and you are not bound to specific timings, this convenient option can be easily integrated with your daily routine. Most of us nowadays use smart phones, so whenever we get time, we can just start learning without facing any other physical hindrances.  With so many options available in your own country, I do not think you have to move to another country just for the sake of learning a new language, which is not only impractical but also expensive.

"With the advancements in information technology, there has been a paradigm shift in the way celebrities are seen/viewed. These days being a celebrity is more about glamour and wealth than about achievements. I fully agree with the argument that this sets a bad example for the adolescents. This position will be proven by analysing how celebrities have corrupted young minds. To begin with, often times celebrities go to great extremes to gain popularity even if this path leads to dangers. Recently, a news story posted by a Russian Instagram model went viral because she held the photo shoot on top of some of the tallest buildings in Dubai. In these death defying pictures, the model was seen on the edge of the rooftops of these buildings. In an attempt to emulate this, a young Chinese girl fell to her death. Obviously, celebrities can have a really negative impact on young people. In addition to this, many celebrities promote materialistic values that can lead youngsters astray. For example, many reality TV shows such as ‘Keeping up with the Kardashian’s try to give the impression that their way of life is what youngsters should aspire for. Such shows inspire many young girls to get obsessed with material possessions and put the relationships and family values on the back burner.Thus it is evident that the extravagant lifestyle of celebrities sets a negative example for young people. In conclusion, after analysing the dangers of religiously following celebrities and the impact they can have on adolescents, I fully believe that these days celebrities are not the role models to look up to. It is hoped that parents and teachers can spread more awareness among youngsters.",8,False,84.67495414713676,280
"Technology is developing at a fast pace. Despite the fact that modern technology has created environmental and social problems, I believe that the convenience and even the safety it has brought to human lives far outweigh its disadvantages. In this essay, I will elaborate on my view. On the one hand, the ever developing / advancing technology is beneficial to us. Firstly, no other technology has had such a great impact on human lives than the internet which is believed to have revolutionized our lives. For instance, people can now purchase goods with a few taps on their mobile screen. The process is made fast and efficient by eliminating the time used in travelling to physical shops. Likewise, innovations in transportation technology have made distances irrelevant. People can now travel anywhere in the world. Actually, mankind is now busy preparing for space travel and colonization. Advancements in the medical field have saved countless lives. Vaccines, for example, are a miracle of science that saved millions of children from the clutches of life.  On the other hand, the demerits of modern inventions can be many. Firstly, the rapid development of technology has created pollution and is devastating to biodiversity. To illustrate, urban encroachment and the daily operation of factories worldwide have damaged the habitats of hundreds and thousands of animals. Scientists worldwide have warned that further destruction to biodiversity is harmful to human beings as it will expose us to insufficient food, medicine and water supply in the near future. Secondly, the invention of internet and computers is addictive. When people spend more time glued to their screens, they have less time left for face to face interactions. Social relationship thus is hampered. To conclude, technological innovations certainly have some downsides; however, it is preposterous to claim that innovations have more demerits than merits.

"To what extent do you agree with this? Many people get into debt due to the careless and improper use of credit cards.Therefore, some people believe that banks should ensure the customer’s ability pay off their debt before issuing them credit cards. I partially agree with this assertion. I believe that the financial stability of individuals can change any time. So ensuring the proper use of credit cards is beyond the control of banks. To begin with, people consider credit cards as a means to improve lifestyles or to borrow money for business. They tend to borrow a large amount of money than they actually are supposed to as the credit cards are easy to use and readily acceptable in so many places.Unfortunately, some people cannot pay back the debts and get into huge financial trouble. Banks usually won’t issue credit cards if they are not completely satisfied with the finances of the people.They often check the income level and the loan history of individuals and explain the burdensome consequences that can happen to the customers before issuing a credit card. However, some people carelessly use credit cards and get into permanent debts. So it is unfair to blame the bank for the credit card holder’s mistakes However, we have to acknowledge the fact that financial situation of anyone can change any time. It cannot be predicted. Usually credit card holders are rich. But at some point they may not be able to pay back the borrowed money due to the challenges in their finances. In this case bank’s calculations can be wrong. As a result, people go into debts. I believe it might be helpful if the bank reminds their customers through text messages or emails when they are overusing the credit cards. It discourages people from further use. Apart from that customers should be able to use their credit cards wisely for their financial well being. To conclude, it is important for the banks to verify the individual’s ability to pay back debits before giving them credit cards. However, I believe citizens are also equally responsible and use their cards carefully to protect themselves from debt.",7,False,68.82480620155039,358

It is a general trend that students consider well developed countries, while they make plans for higher education. I think this comes with numerous advantages. Not only the quality of education is better, but also future career prospects post-graduation are lucrative. For Instance, I moved to USA to pursue my master’s degree and was very impressed with the quality of education, use of modern and effective course delivery techniques, knowledge of teaching staff and so on so forth. Further, good quality education was a key to help me land a job that best suites my career goals. Though the advantages mentioned here look convincing, we need to ponder on the disadvantages. Majority of the students, who travel abroad for higher education, tend to travel alone leaving behind their loved ones. This can be morally challenging and may lead to depression. In addition, many students go through culture shock and find it difficult to acclimatize to new culture .Furthermore, as discussed earlier that quality of education is better, but quality always goes hand in hand with cost for few this can be really challenging and stressful. For example, mybrother had to go through periods of intense stress to get his higher education loan paid off, but thankfully he was able to pay it all has he secured a decent job. In light of the above mentioned aspects, we can see why some people think pursuing higher education abroad is not all advantageous. In conclusion, there are points that can be made for both pros and cons of studying abroad. In my opinion, quality of education and bright career prospects that come along with pursuing higher education abroad outweigh any and all the limitations that come with it.",7,False,86.7403805044891,346
"Several factors affect the growth and development of a child. According to some people / some people opine that parents have a greater role than school in shaping the character of children and making them good members of the society. I agree with this view.  The school is definitely an influence on children. Here they get to meet several other children coming from different social, cultural and financial backgrounds. Interacting with their peers is a great way for kids to learn tolerance and empathy. These two are the most important tools needed to keep our society safe and peaceful. It is important to understand that the school is our second home. So, the school is definitely a good place to learn values and good manners.  However, on the other side of the coin, it is my belief that our parents are more influential than our educational institutions. Our parents are our first teachers. In addition, they are the custodians of our rich culture, traditions and religious beliefs. Moreover, they hold an authority over us unlike the teachers or guides in our educational institutions. In this regard, our parents hold a moral obligation to correct us by taking strict disciplinary measures. This particular authority may not be enjoyed by the teachers in the schools. Because of this parental authority, corrective measures could be enforced by the parents whenever their children go astray. That probably also explains why successful people almost always attribute their success to their parents, and not to the institution they attended. To conclude, I believe that parents and the environment at home play a greater role than the school in moulding a child into a responsible citizen. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Few young people are interested in reading the newspapers or watching news channels. This is definitely a negative development with long lasting consequences. Newspapers and news channels give too much importance to politics and economics and youngsters have little interest in these topics. This is the main reason that discourages them from reading or watching news. Consequently, they have little knowledge of national or international affairs. This is a negative development because young people are the present and the future of the nation. If they are unaware of the happenings around them, they will not be able to play an active role in nation building. Another reason that discourages young people from reading news stories is the information explosion. We are now living in an age where we get bombarded with new bits of information every second. These days news breaks on social media sites like Twitter. When information is available in 140 characters, nobody is interested in reading a 2000 word news story. Unfortunately, there is a downside to this. Social media only provide news; in order to get views we have to read in depth news stories like the ones published in newspapers. Also, it is not always possible to trust information found on the internet. Anyone can post anything online and there is no reliable way to check whether what we have read is true or not. In order to encourage young people to consume news, newspapers and news channels should make a conscious effort to present news in a way that appeals to young readers. Editors and reporters need to realize that in this fast paced world, no one has the time to read a long, winding story. Making information available in byte sizes will definitely help. To conclude, young people are turning a blind eye to newspapers and news channels because much of the information available from these sources does not interest them or is not made available in an easy-to-digest format. Media houses need to rethink their preferences and make some drastic changes to their style of reporting to encourage more and more young people to consume news.",9,False,73.18468865415082,352
"According to some people, every parent should attend the sessions on parenting and child development to ensure the better upbringing of their child. I completely agree with this statement as this way they can reinforce their understanding and knowledge of how to take proper care of their child and become a good parent. The following paragraphs will provide an in-depth insight into the topic. The concept of a nuclear family is gaining popularity these days. It is difficult for young parents to raise their children alone without the guidance of elderly people. These parenting and child development courses work brilliantly in such cases and provide them the knowledge and guidance they need. For example, most young parents are confused about what to feed and what not to feed their children. Courses on parenting give parents an idea about the perfect diet for their children at various ages. Since the years 0-5 are crucial for their development, it is important to ensure that kids are eating a balanced diet.  Moreover, attending such sessions is an opportunity for parents to bond with other parents and share their experiences with them. This could be beneficial in many ways. Sometimes, they might be able to find a solution to one of the parenting problems they face by simply talking to another parent.   To conclude, I firmly believe that young parents should attend such training sessions that enable them to give the best possible care to their children. This is particularly important for parents who are raising their kids without the help and guidance of their parents. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Nowadays cars have become a basic necessity in our day to day life and hence their number has grown large especially in metro cities.  This enormous increase in four wheelers has led to various problems. This essay will discuss some of the problems associated with this issue and put forward some solutions for the same. The first and foremost problem caused by the increase in the number of cars is traffic congestion in metro cities. Because cars have become cheap more and more people are buying them and this in turn leads to more traffic. Tata Nano launched by Tata motors in India in year 2000 has helped a large number of middle class families to own their car. The second problem linked with on road cars is air pollution which causes health hazards at a high rate. Air quality in metro cities has degraded so badly that it is very difficult to breathe in these urban areas. A survey conducted by the government of; always write the government of Delhi in year 2015 showed increased number of asthma patients due to poor air quality. Solutions to the aforementioned problems / the problems discussed above could be to improve the quality of public transportation so that people will prefer to opt for metro or bus services instead of their private vehicles. Secondly there should be a ban on vehicles causing air pollution above a threshold value. The government should impose heavy fines on people breaking these norms. To conclude, the increase in the number of cars causes air pollution and traffic congestion in cities. Improving the reliability of public transport is the best possible solution to this problem.

"Whether or not youngsters should listen to elders is debatable. In my opinion, they certainly should; however, it is also important for young people to consult their peers or use their own judgment in certain situations.  On the one hand, elders have lived much longer than young people and their personal life stories are invaluable. Thanks to the vast experience they have, they are a treasure of wisdom. Because they have already experienced what youngsters are going through presently, their advice is vivid, impactful and sophisticated. Elders can be role models of many young people who are still exploring their early stage of life. Moreover, young people can learn from the mistakes of seniors. Getting advice from elders prevents them from going astray and committing the same mistakes that old people have made. On the other hand, due to fewer opportunities to receive formal education than younger people, old people’s thoughts tend to be more rigid and traditional. For instance, my 85-year-old grandmother still follows the conservative Confucius belief that women are inferior to men. In her opinion, to support the family, women should stay at home and take care of children. Furthermore, many seniors are highly superstitious and refuse to accept scientific wisdom. Even today many of them rely on home remedies.  To conclude, old people are worthy of youngsters’ respect. There are always important lessons that young people can learn when seniors share their life stories. At the same time, elders’ values tend to be traditional. Without proper education in their old days, their problem solving skills are dependent on their life experiences and they cannot always keep up with the fast-paced life of today.

"It is often said that education is the gateway to a successful life. Hence it is argued that students ought to study in schools until the age of eighteen years. I completely agree with this view. The most important reason for making school education mandatory for all students is the potential professional opportunities it offers. This is because the majority of the skilled jobs require a minimum level of education, which could only be achieved if one stays in school till the age of eighteen. For instance, professional subjects like engineering, medicine, law and management cannot be learnt in primary school. Hence, it is necessary to stay in school for a longer period of time, if one wants to learn these skills. Of course, there are some students who are not good at academics and they may want to build a career in other fields which require vocational training. However, it is not necessary for them to drop out because most schools now impart vocational training as well along with core subjects. For example, a student who wants to become a carpenter can join the apprentice course and continue to learn his academic subjects. In other words, there is no need to drop out of school to obtain vocational skills. What’s more, high school education will make it easier for them to survive in the real world when they enter their adulthood. In conclusion, I firmly believe that schooling should be mandatory till the age of eighteen as it provides many future opportunities which cannot be ignored unless there are some specific benefits to dropping out.

"There is no doubt that regular physical exercise is vital for everyone. While it is argued that ensuring the physical fitness of children is the sole responsibility of parents, I partially disagree with this point and insist that it is the joint responsibility of parents and schools. I will elucidate the reasons in the subsequent paragraphs. Those who opine that the onus is on parents to ensure the fitness of their children believe that they are completely responsible for raising them and for their holistic development. This is because juveniles can be supervised by their parents in a facile manner unlike at schools where it is not possible to provide individual attention to each student. For instance, if a child is interested in any type of sports such as cricket, parents play crucial role in encouraging their child and ensuring that his interest is pursued. As a result, children will feel motivated to follow their passion and be physically fit. On the other hand, in my view, schools should include / provide sports coaching as part of syllabus because it will imbibe competitive attitude in students not only for sports but also for other subjects. Besides, it will help them learn team management skills at a young age and it will be advantageous for them in long run. For instance, sports day in schools creates huge excitement among pupils because they compete with one another and prove their mettle. Moreover, it is seen that physically fit students often perform better in studies because they are mentally fit as well due to regular exercise at schools. In conclusion, although it is undeniable that parents are responsible for their children’s physical development, in my view, it is the combined responsibility of the parents and the school.

"In the era of globalisation, learning a foreign dialect provides numerous opportunities for students. According to some educationalists, children should be taught a non-native language like English from Elementary School instead of Higher Secondary. In my opinion, this has more benefits than drawbacks. There are certainly a few drawbacks to learning a foreign language at primary school. The first and the most obvious one is that children are too young to understand the depth of other languages, notably, vocabulary, grammar, pronunciation. In other words, they are not intellectually mature enough to assimilate the richness of a foreign language. What is more, since students at this age do not even fully comprehend their mother tongue, emphasis on a foreign dialect may leave them in an awkward situation. Consequently, it puts some extra burden on them. In spite of the points mentioned above, I still argue that learning a foreign language in the inception stage of schooling is advantageous. The primary reason is that youngsters have more grasping power than adults. As a result, what they learn at this age gets imprinted on their mind. As the children grows, this language learning ability diminishes. To elaborate, research conducted by a language learning institute in California on 1000 students of 5 to 12 age group found that at this age the mind is better equipped to acquire knowledge. Additionally, learning a non-indigenous language is a time-consuming process. If students embark learning early, by the time they reach high school, they will become proficient in it. Secondly, when students study in Higher Secondary School, they do not have to put extra efforts to understand the foreign language. As a result, students can focus on their course subjects like physics, chemistry and mathematics. Hence, they will receive better academic results.  To recapitulate, it is apparent from the aforementioned arguments that the disadvantages of learning a foreign language at primary class are negligible when compared to the benefits it provides.

"Some people feel that children get too much free time. In their opinion, kids should use their spare time to do their school assignments. I do not agree with me. In my opinion, free time is essential for the overall growth and development of children and it should not be used for academic work. To start with, I do not agree with the view that children get a lot of free time. Most children spend a great deal of time at school and once they get home they have to do their homework. Therefore, it is unfair to ask them to do their school work in the few spare hours they get. Parents and teachers who insist that children should only study and not play are actually doing them a major disservice. Contrary to what some people believe, leisure is actually important for the wellbeing of both children and adults. Free time allows children to relax and engage in activities they enjoy. Studies have shown that children who play well are actually healthier and more intelligent. Obesity has become a major health problem among children who lead a sedentary lifestyle. By encouraging them to play a physical sport in their free time, parents can actually protect them from a variety of ailments. Since physically active children fall ill less often they do not miss many school days. Actually both factors improve their grades in school. They are also happier than their counterparts who are always busy with their studies. Better still, free time allows children to discover and hone their latent talents. To conclude, the argument that children should do their school work in their free time is meaningless. In order to succeed in life they should not only study but also play.",9,False,68.04593806710685,293
"Since time immemorial, art has played a crucial role in depicting the culture of its society. The various forms of ancient art that are studied and researched till date reflect the skill level and knowledge of that era. In the modern society, art is an integral part of school curriculum providing children with freedom to express themselves. However, it is very important that a balance is maintained between studies and arts. It is a proven fact that art is a good way of releasing tensions and stress. This further helps to bring their creative side out and enables them to express themselves better. For instance, psychologists can understand the thought process of children by studying their drawings. The pictures they create and colors they use show what they feel about the happenings in their surroundings. But at the same time, it is imperative that equal attention is given to academics as well because not everyone can earn their livelihood from art. For practicing professions like medicine or teaching one has to be academically strong. similarly for jobs like plumbing and carpentry one has to excel in skills that refine with practice. Therefore, children should be encouraged to focus on the academics as well. To conclude, it is very important to strike a balance between art and academics because both are beneficial in their own ways. If arts provide a platform to express one’s imagination freely, studies provide an opportunity to pursue professional careers. However, in my opinion, pursuing art at the expense of other subjects is not a wise idea. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Public smoking is banned in many countries now. Consequently, people who want to light a cigarette have to leave the public place and go to designated areas where smoking is allowed. I fully support this restriction on smoking. If people cannot smoke in public places many of them will eventually quit the habit because finding a designated smoking area may be hard.  There are several reasons to ban smoking in public places. To start with, it is injurious to health. Smoking causes various health problems like respiratory illnesses and cancer. Worse still, it hurts not only the smoker but also those around them. Several studies have shown that passive smoking is as bad as active smoking. Children and the elderly are the worst affected by this. Protecting them from the health consequences of passive smoking is the responsibility of the government. Banning smoking in public places is the most effective way of doing this. If smoking is not allowed in public places, smokers will have to find a designated smoking area when they feel the urge. This is not always easy and hence it may actually encourage these people to quit the habit of smoking. Eventually, this simple measure will prove to be beneficial for all and hence it should be supported.  In conclusion, smoking is an unhealthy habit that cannot be encouraged. Banning smoking in public places is a measure in the right direction because it not only protects non-smokers from the harmful consequences of tobacco but also encourages smokers to quit the habit.

"While some people think that smart phones play an important role in the learning process of students, others believe that excessive use of these devices does not help to achieve academic objectives. This essay is against / I am against the excessive use of smart phones among teenagers because after spending much of their time on these devices, teenagers are left with no time for their studies. Moreover, children do not like to play sports because they prefer to play games with their mobile phones. When teenagers spend most of their time on mobile phones, it is natural that they will not have time for academic studies. The time spent on phones is not productive; therefore, traditional academic learning should be encouraged instead. Also, juveniles who are always glued to their phone use it excessively for chatting with their friends. While chatting is not particularly bad, the problem is that they use weird abbreviations and SMS lingos to convey ideas. Their conversation makes practically no sense to someone who is not familiar with this time. At the same time, they fail to learn to communicate using standard words and expressions. No doubt, this generation of students has poor written communication skills. Spending excessive time on their phones also prevents students from reading. Earlier people used to read when they had free time. Actually, many of them made a conscious effort to find time to read something. These days, teens are constantly hooked to their phones. They read neither newspapers nor storybooks. Instead they keep themselves busy updating their social status. Needless to say, they have limited knowledge of the world they live in.  In conclusion, the use of mobile phones does not help in the learning process and hurts the literacy skills of young people.

"Coal, oil and natural gas are major sources of energy all over the world. Of late, authorities have started promoting the use of renewable sources like wind and solar. In my opinion, this is a positive development because unlike coal or petrol, renewable sources are eco-friendly.  Firstly, it is undeniable that the usage of non-renewable resources has increased at an alarming rate. Fossil fuel currently supplies 85% of the world’s energy, but when burned, their carbon emissions are the main contributor to global warming. This leads to several problems like melting of glaciers in the poles, depletion of ozone layer and so on.  On the other hand, renewable source produces clean energy. Thus, it creates a pollution-free environment and increases the quality of our planet as well as life on earth. For example, the WHO organization reported that there is a dramatic improvement in the air quality in the European countries after they started relying more on solar energy 10 years ago.  Secondly, fossil fuel requires millions of years to form from the dead vegetations and animals that get buried deep inside the earth and it cannot be produced in the laboratory as it requires extreme temperature and pressure. Therefore, the use of fossil fuel at this rate will lead to their exhaustion. Besides, it cannot be reused once it burned. Unlike non-renewable energy, renewable energy is derived from resources that are replenished naturally. In addition, while the initial cost of installation is pretty high, the cost savings over the years easily justify this investment in solar or wind energy.  In conclusion, switching to alternative sources of energy like solar or wind is a positive development because they produce clean and green energy that does not cause any real harm to the environment. Also, these sources are renewable and hence there is no danger of them ever getting exhausted.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"At school students learn a variety of subjects ranging from arts and music to literature and science. Some people insist that universities should follow the same pattern and teach a variety of students to all the students. I do not agree with this view because this method is not beneficial for the student or the society. By the time students finish high school, they have acquired a decent understanding of a variety of subjects. For example, most of them can read and write two or three languages, do sums, identify the symptoms of common ailments and understand the basic concepts of physics, chemistry and geography. This knowledge is adequate for most people to go about their day to day lives. And for those who want to build a career in a specific field, specialization is the key. For example, someone who wants to be a doctor does not benefit from learning calculus or trigonometry. Likewise, an architect does not have to understand thermodynamics or astrophysics. Rather what they need is in depth knowledge in their field of interest. If universities teach all subjects to all students they will not manage to produce professionals with cutting edge knowledge and expertise in specific fields. Obviously, this method of learning or teaching jeopardizes the job prospects of the students and the welfare of the society. In every society there is a need for specialists and the only way to produce specialists is to impart education that focuses on specific subjects. To conclude, the argument that universities should teach a variety of subjects to all students does not hold water because it not only hurts the job prospects of the individual but also creates a dearth of specialists in the society.",9,False,63.94191239002824,287
"It is argued that museums and art galleries should only showcase the art works of the host country. I completely disagree with this opinion because in my opinion art is a medium to express thoughts and ideas and it cannot be confined to geographical boundaries. I believe art is pure in its form and it is a medium to express our ideas and thoughts freely. An artist does not draw a painting by limiting himself to the locality of his origin. He simply pours his expressions and feelings on a piece of paper with different shades of color. These shades and sketches depict the painter’s vision of history, or reality. Such a masterpiece should not be restricted only to local origins; rather, it should be showcased in front of a global audience. Moreover, when we allow arts and sculptures from a foreign country we are connecting the nations all over the worlds. Each culture has something new to teach. For example, in one of the child museums in India, there are paintings of small children dressed as Zombies. These paintings depict the Halloween festival which is very famous among children in America. Children in India are delighted to know about such festival. Similarly, we have Madame Tussads, a popular celebrity museum in England. The museum hosts wax statues of several famous personalities of all over the world. For example, it hosts the statue of Mahatma Gandhi describing the work he did for achieving India’s independence. To conclude, museums and art galleries should not be restricted only to local origins and should depict the cultures and artworks of other countries too.

"Discipline is important for the all round development of children; however, nowadays many students seem to lack it. According to some people parents are responsible for inculcating the value of discipline in their children; others insist that it is the duty of teachers. I agree with the former view. Different schools have different subjects depending on the child’s age and each subject is taught by a specific teacher. It is highly unlikely that each teacher teaches the same standards of discipline to all pupils across all grades. Each child is different and has to be molded depending on the child’s behavior. To illustrate further, the school near my house has 40 students in one class. The teacher often finds it very difficult to control the class and teach the lesson within the allotted time. The teacher is more concerned about explaining the lesson and completing the course and gives less attention to those who misbehave in their class.   On the contrary, parents observe their kid very closely since their birth. They tend to spend a lot of time with their children during their free time at home. Since they interact more with their child, they have an opportunity to teach them discipline and mend their behavior. Children often try to imitate their parents and learn behavioral skills from them. For example, my son wakes up early in the morning and gets ready for school as we all get ready for our offices. This behavior was not taught by any of us; rather it was something he learned from his own observation. To conclude this essay, teachers in this modern era find it extremely difficult to discipline all the children and mend their ways within the allotted time. It is the responsibility of the parents to discipline their child and show them what is right and wrong. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"These days, the hectic lifestyle has increased the stress level among people. A few psychologists suggest that one of the ways to get rid of stress is to stay idle for some time. In my opinion, stress is preventing us from enjoying our happy moments and inviting acute diseases. I strongly agree with the argument that stealing some time from daily chores to give rest to your mind, helps in reducing the stress level. To begin with, the brain, like any other human body part, needs time to repair the damaged tissues. The brain works in a manner similar to a machine. And if we overload it with numerous activities, then it will collapse at one stage. Therefore, we need to give it rest by taking some time-off. In a recent survey it was found that people who work more than 14 hours a day are 80% more likely to die in their 50s. On the other hand, there are many benefits to doing nothing. By not engaging in any work, we can divert our mind towards good old memories. It releases good hormones in our body. These feel good hormones refresh our mind and provide extra energy. Also we can use this time to converse with the family members. It contributes to developing strong bond among family members. For example, studies have shown that people who spend a lot of time with their family have considerably reduced risk of developing cardiac problems. In conclusion, stress is like a termite. It not only kills the present joy but also ruins future plans. Hence, it is not healthy to constantly focus on our life goals. An occasional break from these priorities will help to alleviate stress and bring peace to mind and life. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"There is a general belief that there are many health and environmental benefits to vegetarianism. While I do agree with this view, I do not think that vegetarianism is for everyone.  The consumption of animal products certainly has some health consequences. It hurts the environment as well. Some studies have shown that vegetarians tend to live longer than their meat or fish eating counterparts. The environmental impacts of non-vegetarianism are even worse. Annually, countless animals are raised, abused and slaughtered to fulfill the demand for meat and fish worldwide. Framing livestock is one of the major causes of green house gas emissions worldwide. If we can reduce the consumption of meat, the need for raising more animals also reduces. As a result, the land that is being used to raise them can be altered to grow vegetables which in turn produce clean air for the whole planet. Obviously, cutting down on the consumption of animal products benefits the whole world. On the other hand, meat and fish are integral part of many cuisines; therefore, being a vegetarian is not an option in many regions of the world. To illustrate, sushi is the most popular Japanese delicacy and without the addition of its main ingredient, fish, sushi will not be complete. Meat consumption is particularly common in cold countries. There are also some regions where it is difficult to grow vegetables and cereals. Furthermore, fish and meat are excellent sources of proteins and some fatty acids crucial for good health. For this season, meat consumption is essential for people engaging in strenuous physical activities. Being vegetarian, for example, is not a viable option for a body builder or an athlete.  In conclusion, even though there are advantages to vegetarianism, I believe that this lifestyle is not for everyone.

"Artists generally earn less all over the world; therefore it is believed that the government should help them financially so that they can continue their work. I completely agree with this sentiment as artists represent a country on the international stage so they have to be encouraged and also they play an important role in shaping the culture and history of a nation.  Art knows no boundaries and any good piece of art is appreciated around the world and this helps a nation to get recognition in the international circuit. In order to encourage this, the state has to fund the under paid artists so that they can represent their country in various fields. For instance, the greatest Bismillah Khan who used to play a musical instrument called Shehnai was from a very humble background. He was very talented and one of the best in his field. The government recognized this and supported him in every way. He went on to become the best musician in his domain globally and received many international awards. Thus we can see how funding an artist can make a country proud on the international platform.  Furthermore, artists play a significant role in taking the traditional culture forward through music, food, movies and many other artistic activities. As a result, in order to give a boost to the cultural activities the government should fund all the deserving artists. For example, handicraft industry is a very old form of art work in India. It is not a very highly paid job but directly connected to the traditions and customs of India. To support these handicraft workers the state has implemented many schemes through which they can obtain the benefits and gain reasonable amount of profit from their work. This step by the government has kept the traditional handicraft industry alive. Thus, clearly it is very vital for the administration to support the artists so that the old form of art and tradition is preserved and maintained.   In conclusion, I firmly believe that the government has to support artists and fund them so that they can flourish in their fields and thus preserve the traditional culture and bring international recognition to a nation in different spheres.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Traffic accidents are on the rise these days. Most of the accidents  injuries or  death. Research have found that most of the accidents are caused by inexperienced drivers, for example young drivers.Young drivers tend to be more daring and are unable to avoid a crush when they face one. They tend to be more daring after drinking alcohol at night and this causes them to lose control of the car. Drunk driving will not only risk a person’s own life but may also cause an  life to be lost.The government should encourage the driving  to conduct driving lessons for drivers for a longer period. This will give them a clear picture about how accidents happen and teach them about the safety of others on the road. Drivers that have been in an accident after drunk driving should be  from driving for at least two years and be given driving lessons again.However, for the aged drivers, the government should not only  the age limit but also check the capability of the aged drivers for instance eyesight, hearing and other related health conditions to ensure safe driving. It does not mean that an aged person  not fit to drive and has a problem with the heart but a young or a middle aged person could also have heart failure these days.To conclude, I feel that to raise the  of young drivers not the best solution but to  about the problems they may encounter on the road and to ban them from driving if they have caused an accident due to carelessness. As for the  drivers, as long as they are capable on the road before a certain age and there are no health issues there shouldn’t be a problem.",6,False,54.9353103035116,287
"Planning for the future has been the most crucial aspect of human life. Some people argue that instead of worrying about the future, we should live in the present. This approach certainly has its own benefits, but I believe that making strategies for the future is more advantageous for a person who wants to succeed in his life. Undoubtedly, planning for the future keeps a person motivated and ambitious throughout his lifetime. In other words, an individual with clear career goals and objectives will work hard towards achieving them. For instance, my friend succeeded in IAS exam recently because started preparing for it while he was in high school itself. Hence, it goes without saying that people who plan ahead are the ones who really taste the fruit of success. Moreover, creating a master plan for the times ahead encourages a person to save money for investment in future projects such as their business goals or their children’s education. Also the money thus saved will help them tide over any financial crises that they may face in the future. For example, I have been saving money for the last few years and this habit enabled me to pay for my child’s treatment for an autoimmune disorder. However, some people assert that planning for the future is quite stressful and therefore living in the present keeps them happy and contented. Also, in their opinion, no one can change their destiny and if they are destined to lose something, they will lose it no matter what. But, in my opinion, this is not a wise strategy. Even if this is true to a certain extent, a little bit of planning will certainly help us to cope better in difficult times. In conclusion, even though future planning may be a little stressful, I believe that it in the long term it is the key to success.",8,False,86.50962639584083,313
"The subjects chosen at university can play a crucial role in the life of a student. Many people are of the view that only subjects which can be utilized vocationally should be chosen. However, I believe that students should be allowed to study the subjects of their choice. To begin with, many individuals think that students should choose subjects which are useful for their future life and career. This is because studying in institutes of higher learning requires significant financial investment. In addition, often many years of learning are needed to acquire a university degree. Hence, many people expect immediate monetary returns for their strenuous efforts. One way of getting it is by choosing a subject such as science and technology which can be utilized for finding a good job immediately after completing one’s course. Furthermore, some people think that only newer scientific innovations and latest technology are necessary for a society to advance. However, in my opinion, students should not be compelled to choose any specific subject. Not all students are alike. Their interests, aptitudes and inclinations vary widely. Forcing students to study subjects which do not interest them will only burden them. What’s more, they will not be able to understand the subject well and will not be able to utilize it in future. Moreover, in addition to scientists and technology experts, our society requires scholars who excel in philosophy, arts, politics, accounts etc. For a society to truly progress, scholars with varied backgrounds and expertise are needed. To conclude, in my perspective, students should be given the opportunity to learn subjects of their interest/ choice. This is because doing this will be beneficial for the students as well as the society.",8,False,68.06733353747747,284
"As a result of the growth of supermarkets in some countries, many local businesses have died out. Some people argue that without local business, local communities will not exist. In my opinion, even though the closure of regional enterprises may bring some difficulties to the local community, it will not endanger their existence. Lack of traditional retail stores in a locality may pose some problems to the local population. People have to travel to the nearest shopping centre to get the items. It is a more expensive and time consuming activity compared to getting the items from local shops. In addition to this, in case of any emergency, when people do not have much time to waste to get the item, lack of local shops may put them in more trouble. For example, if some visitors turn up unexpectedly, the presence of small stores nearby will help people to treat them adequately. Even though local population have to encounter certain difficulties due to the lack of small retail stores, it will not affect their existence. In the modern society, there are many supermarkets and shopping malls in all towns and cities. And also, people love to travel to these places and enjoy their shopping. In fact, in the current society, people prefer to buy items from supermarkets and shopping malls as these places offer many facilities such as cinema halls and restaurants for people to enjoy. Cheap transportation modes are also available to go to nearby shopping centres. In conclusion, although the closure of regional shops may affect the local population negatively to a small extent, it will not threaten their existence.",8,False,64.56613942589338,272
"It is true that well-known people’s association with global aid programmes can have a serious impact on the society. Some people believe that the reputation of these individuals can overshadow the cause they are working for. However, I believe that the support of celebrities will create public awareness about the problems that need to be dealt with. It is my strong belief that famous people’s association with international aid organisations can raise public awareness towards certain matters of importance. It is evident that they can positively influence their fans who can be encouraged to participate in charitable activities held by the organisations. For example, some Taiwanese celebrities volunteer in developing countries such as Kenya and support disadvantaged local families. Due to this fact, many fans of these celebrities turn their attention to the problems such as poverty and engage themselves in voluntary work for a variety of global aid organisations. Therefore, famous people’s involvement in the organisations can certainly raise people’s awareness of global issues. However, there is a commonly held view that celebrities can downplay the impact of problems. This is because people might perceive their contributions to international aid organisations as their business strategy to advertise themselves, and to gain more fame. For instance, numerous Hollywood movie stars engage themselves in voluntary work for international charities, but their endeavour is less likely to be appreciated due to misconceptions of the public. This can trivialize the problems. However, in my opinion, there are only a small group of people who do not appreciate celebrities’ hard work.  In conclusion, although celebrities could take the focus off of the problems due to their popularity, my belief is that their contributions to international aid organisations can surely make problems noticed.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"  There is no denying the fact that family ties are becoming weaker. This is particularly true in western countries where relationships are becoming less and less relevant. There are several reasons behind this unfortunate development. The most important, of course, is the change in our lifestyles, values and goals. Families that spend a lot of time together tend to be closer. And families where the members rarely come face to face with one another have hardly anything that ties them together. In the olden days parents and children used to live and work together. In many families, children pursued the same career as their father. They learned the trade or craft from their parents and elder siblings. This allowed them to spend more time with their family and that made their relationships stronger. Now we are living in the age of individualism. Everyone needs their space. This has made us more self-centred than our parents or grandparents. This also reflects in our relationships. We no longer believe in making adjustments or compromises. We want everything our way. This attitude creates strain in our relationships. There is yet another reason that affects family bonds. People are increasingly moving to another city or country in search of better education, jobs or living standards. They leave their family behind. While it is possible to keep in touch through modern communication means, an email or phone call is not equal to a face-to-face interaction. The only way to forge better ties with our near and dear ones is to spend more time with them. We must realize that our biggest strength is our family. Relationships are like potted plants. We need to nourish them. If we don’t give them the love and affection they need, they will wilt. To conclude, if we need better family relationships we must be willing to adjust and compromise. We must realize that the only way to win love is to give love. Instead of confining ourselves to our space, we must come out of it. We must let others in too.",9,False,68.6,343
"Most of the historical places such as forts, monuments and museums are a point of attraction for the tourists. It is a common observation that natives / native people do not visit these places. One major reason for this is that visiting such places repeatedly is monotonous. Plus, the local public do not wish to spend money on entry tickets to visit the same place again and again. However, it is possible to attract local residents to these sites by taking certain measures. This essay will discuss the mentioned causes and the solutions to attract locals to these places.  One important reason for the local public to not visit the local historical places is that they have nothing new to offer. Many prefer to visit multiplexes and amusement parks which are loaded with new attractions. Hence, museums and art galleries which have the same exhibits on display cannot pull the local crowd. Another important reason is the entry fees. Entry fees at museums and historical places can hinder a local tourist from visiting them. No one is interested in paying for entry to see the same artefacts on display again and again. For example, a fort built by King Bhosle at Nagpur has very few local visitors owing to the hefty entry fees.  However, by taking few actions this issue can be taken care of. Adding new attractions to museums and forts can gain the attention of native visitors. Historical places will be able to pull more local crowd if they have additional activities to offer. For example, forts in Rajasthan organise cultural programmes by folk artists who rotate on weekly basis. Such rotation amongst different folk artists for performances can keep a place lively and enjoyable. In addition, waving off the entry fee for the local residents can boost the number of local visitors. To illustrate, the Raman Science Centre at Nagpur is gathering a considerable number of native visitors since it waived off the entry fee for the locals. In conclusion, the monotony of local historical places can be changed by reviving them with new attractions. Also, entry fee waiver is an important step to push native people to visit local places frequently. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"According to some people, we no longer have to go to cinema halls because movies can be watched on portable devices like mobile phones. I do not fully agree with this opinion. While I do admit that mobile phones have made films available round the clock, big screens certainly have their advantage and they are here to stay.  On the one hand, some people think that movies can be watched on mobiles or tablets instead of cinema and I agree with them. In other words, because of the technological advancement, the electronic devices enable the viewers to watch movies from anywhere and at anytime. This unique feature helps people to watch movies when they have free time. For example, I daily utilise the commuting time to watch movies from the mobile applications such as Netflix and Hotstar. Moreover, the broad casting companies such as Netflix and Hotstar offer their movie subscriptions at very affordable prices. Another point to consider is that old movies which are not played in the cinemas can still be watched on those devices. On the other hand, it is often believed by some people that movies can be completely enjoyed only in a movie theatre. Movies can be entertaining if watched in theatre because of its advanced sound technology and wider viewing screen. Also, action movies can be enjoyed due to better sound quality. Furthermore, many 3-D movies are designed for only cinemas and they cannot be watched at home or on any devices. To illustrate, movies such as Avatar and Captain Marvel are enjoyed most when watched in the theatre. Another reason to watch movies at theatre is that it is a good family pastime. Because of these recreational activities families stay connected and happy. To conclude, watching movies in cinemas is certainly the best option if we want to enjoy it fully. However, in my opinion, watching films on a mobile device is a cheaper, easier and more convenient option suitable for most people. Also, while it is true that a smartphone of a laptop cannot match the sound effects or visual quality offered by cinema screens, technologies are developing and movies are now fully enjoyable even on small screens.

"The contamination of air and water caused predominantly by industries and construction activities is a big problem faced by developing countries. The government can take certain measures to reduce air and water pollution. For example, it can have a regulatory board which monitors the activities of factories and construction companies to ensure that they meet emission standards. The government should also enact laws that move industries to peripheral areas of the city. This essay will discuss these measures in detail. Industrial emission can be kept in check/ control by having regulatory bodies which periodically examine the waste they produce and issue certificates. This certificate should be valid for only a few months and on its expiry, the board should perform the quality checks again If the factory does not renew the certificate, their license to operate should be cancelled. Another measure is to have all the industries outside city limits so that the pollutants do not affect the people.  Similar regulatory board can be formed for construction business as well. Since construction can happen anywhere in the city, this board should make sure that the air pollutants like cement and sand do not spread around. They can also check if the construction company has measures in place to treat waste water so that it does not pollute sources of drinking water.  In conclusion, the widely faced problem of air and water pollution in several developing countries can be reduced by appointing regulatory boards. These boards should enforce strict rules for industries and construction to ensure that they conform to standards pertaining to air and water pollutants. In addition, the government should move industries to areas outside the city.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Currently, many parents tend to be busy working and they have to rely on someone else to look after their children. While some people think childcare organisations can offer the best care, in my perspective, it is better for children to be looked after by their grandparents. On the one hand, some parents believe that children should be sent to child care centres for some reasons. The first reason is that these centres are professional organisations and their staff are well trained so they have good babysitting skills. For example, when a child falls over and gets himself injured, the well trained staff in the care centres will act quickly and give first aid. Furthermore, child care organisations have many children from different backgrounds. This helps children mingle with them and make friends with their peers which might increase their communication and language abilities. On the other hand, I believe it is a better idea for grandparents to take care of their grandchildren. Firstly, grandparents are well experienced in raising children because they have brought up their own children. For example, they know how to calm down children when they cry. Secondly, grandparents are family members, so they love their grandchildren more than other people do. As a result, they tend to spend more time and take more effort to care for their grandchildren. This is not exactly possible in day care centres because they have to take care of several kids at the same time. Consequently, there is a limit to the attention they can give to each child. Another advantage of leaving children in the care of their grandparents is that they are more likely to be family oriented when they grow up. Also, children raised by grandparents pick up family values much faster. In conclusion, while there are some benefits to sending children to child care centres, I believe they should be raised by their own grandparents because they can give much more love and attention than care takers at day care centres.",8,False,61.484237726098186,336

"Some people argue that famous people should behave responsibly as their conduct can influence others. I fully agree with this opinion because they have a profound impact on the society and can even shape public opinion.  The predominant reason why celebrities need to be careful about /mindful of their behaviour in public is that they are revered by millions around the world. For instance, film stars are admired and copied by several youngsters. When these stars start a new fashion trend, it is immediately copied by their fans who even imitate their mannerisms. It is therefore important that they set a good example. Because of this influence, celebrities need to watch their actions. They should never indulge in activities that can cause problems in the society. For example, famous people should desist from commenting on politically or religiously sensitive issues as their comments can create polarization in the society. Likewise, they should not indulge in harmful habits like smoking, drinking or substance abuse because their actions are imitated by millions including children. Another reason for celebrities to set a good example is that they can inspire others. For example, when a celebrity gets involved in charitable work, countless others follow suit. This is a great opportunity for them to make a positive contribution to the world. By contrast, if they only promote the flamboyant lifestyle they will send the wrong message that life is all about glam and glitz.  In conclusion, it is imperative that famous people act responsibly when they are in the public eye. Celebrities can immensely influence masses with their work, lifestyle and political views, and hence it is important for them to set the right example.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"These days, it is seen that youth crime is increasing at a faster rate than ever before. Some people believe that it is mainly because of the lack of parental supervision of their children. I can only partially agree with this argument because I believe that there are also many other factors which contribute to the increased rate of crime among youngsters. To begin with, inadequate knowledge about ethical behavior or societal rules is the prime reason for young people to commit crime. The current economic condition of the society pushes both the parents to pursue professional careers to ensure better life prospects and educational facilities for their children. Thus, parents are left with no time to guide their children about the ethical norms of mankind. When left alone, children may spend their time watching TV or surfing the internet. They may also make friends with people outside of their social network. Such friendships can actually push children into wrong doing. They may develop bad habits like smoking, drinking or substance abuse. Since parents are absent for most part of the day, they main remain ignorant of their children’s activities until it is too late.  However, the absence of parents is not the only reason for the rise in criminal activity among young people. Youngsters coming from families where one or both parents are present throughout the day also get into crime. They are misled by several factors including the violence shown on television and movies. Peer pressure is another factor that leads juveniles astray. Poverty and lack of educational opportunities are all factors that encourage criminal activity among young people.  In conclusion, I strongly believe that inadequate parental guidance is only one of the reasons for crime among young people. Exposure to violence, growing consumerism and peer pressure also encourage many juveniles to commit acts that are illegal or unethical.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some people put forth the argument that movies are less valuable art forms than literature and paintings. I completely disagree with this argument. In my opinion, films have the same artistic value as writings and drawings.  It is true that literature, paintings and sculptures have a much longer history than movies. They are also deeply rooted in the culture and that makes them priceless representation of various eras. For example, literature of each century gives us an accurate description of life in those times. Paintings and sculptures have the same value. Needless to say they are a goldmine of information for historians and anthropologists. However, it is wrong to measure the historic and aesthetic value of an art form by the number of years it has been in existence. It is true that films are a newer form of art and entertainment. However, just like literature and paintings, films also reflect the era in which they are made. They also showcase the growth of technology. What’s more films are intrinsically linked to literature and there are many filmy adaptations of classic literature. Another advantage that films have over other art forms is that they enjoy mass appeal. Actually, films reach a greater audience than books or other art forms. This popularity itself makes them a valuable form of art and a good medium for conveying socio-cultural messages. Better still, unlike a novel or a drawing, a film is a labour of love of hundreds of artists and technicians and going to cinema is rated as the highest form of entertainment today.  To conclude, I believe that films / movies have the same artistic value as literature and painting. One cannot gauge the value of films merely from the number of years of history they have; nor can one consider them less valuable just because aesthetic preferences differ.

"With the increasing popularity of new age / electronic media, traditional newspapers seem less appealing and unnecessary to many people. I believe that this trend is inevitable; however, it does not mean that print media has become redundant.  As technology has developed at an astounding pace, a considerable number of people have gadgets, such as mobile phones and the computers, which allow them to find information at any time, so fewer people read print newspapers today. If they want to check what is happening around the world, what they need to do is to just press some buttons on their screen. This way of accessing news has many advantages over reading print newspapers in terms of time efficiency and convenience, and that is why most modern people are no longer big fans of print newspapers. Another reason why print newspapers are no longer needed is that their presentation of information is monotonous while the various functions of the digital news are more engaging and personalized. The discussion board of news online provides viewers with opportunities to exchange their ideas about how they perceive the news events; with notifications of digital news, subscribers can be well informed of the most updated information, so they will not miss any important news reports. All these features cannot be found in print newspapers because they just display information with texts and photographs. On the other hand, reading newspapers in a traditional way may be preferred by some people, as print newspapers are more authoritative in terms of the authenticity of information. To publish an issue of newspaper, it involves a series of processes such as journalists collecting information on spot and editors proofreading reports multiple times. These vigorous steps greatly ensure the reliability of news. By contrast, much of online news is not true because each internet user is able to publish news and make it go it go viral. Readers of this kind of fault information will be misled. In conclusion, print newspapers are still needed because of their inherent merits that online media lack.

"Both men and women have started equally working in every nation, and hence it is natural that they should divide their household chores among themselves. I agree with this viewpoint as this way of life provides several advantages such as a stress-free life and courage to be independent. To begin with, sharing home chores mainly reduces the work pressure of the couple. Sharing domestic chores reduces the pressure on couples. If one of them has to do all the work alone after office hours, they will be under tremendous pressure. Eventually, the person who does all the domestic work will have no option but quit their job. This will make them miss out on their career and create feelings of resentment. By contrast, sharing household work enables both spouses to have a flourishing career and stress free family life.  Sharing household chores also enables both men and women to be independent. This is because both of them learn to do each and every job at home, and can run the house independently when one of them is out of town. For example, many software professionals benefit from this phenomenon because their job requires them to travel abroad frequently leaving their family.  In conclusion, working couples should share their household chores because it will help them reduce the workload and in turn, the stress. Furthermore, it enables them to be independent when they are all alone. Every working couple should be encouraged to adopt this lifestyle for leading a relaxed life.

"Some individuals prefer to attend a live sports event whereas others choose / like to be at home and view it on the small screens. This essay will shed some light on both perspectives in the forthcoming paragraphs before reaching a reasonable conclusion.  To embark upon, people feel excited when they watch any sports event in the stadium as it provides them a live atmosphere with excited spectators who cheer for their favorite sportsperson and team. This instils in them happiness, team spirit, and patriotism. Needless to say, watching a live event in a stadium is an experience one will cherish for a long time. For example, every year in my country, India, millions of people attend live IPL cricket tournaments to motivate their sports idols and celebrate the success of their favourite team.  On the other hand, watching the same sports event in the comfort of our home is convenient and cost-effective. This is mainly because it enables all the family members to unite and spend quality time together. In addition, with the sophisticated technological devices, it is now possible to repeat or pause a particular moment of action. Furthermore, traveling and ticket expenses can be avoided if we watch live or premiered athlete event in the comfort of our zone. For example, according to a survey conducted by Harvard University, 75% of the world population prefers to watch sports events on their smart phones and television because it is less expensive / because it is more affordable.  In conclusion, although there are certain positive benefits to watching live sports events in my opinion, watching it on the television in our comfort zone like home is more economical and convenient.",8,False,85.11231884057972,278
"It has become more common for museums to charge an entry fee from visitors. In my opinion, the benefits of this practice outweigh the disadvantages. When museums charge a fee for entry, they can offer better facilities to their visitors. For example, they can hire more people to offer warmer and more considerate services to tourists. They can hire more knowledgeable guides who can provide accurate information about the pieces on display. They can even hire people to babysit for the couples who want to enjoy the museum without getting disturbed by the ruckus created by their little babies. In addition, they can invest in wheelchairs for differently enabled people. Obviously, there are clear benefits to charging an entry fee.  On top of this, the income from the sale of tickets is more stable than the donations received from patrons. Museums that offer free entry depend entirely on the measly funds provided by the government. Consequently, they cannot maintain the museum properly. This actually leads to a fall in the number of visitors. That means even if entry is fee, few people will want to visit the museums. By contrast, tourists will throng museums with state-of-the-art facilities even if there is an entry fee. Needless to say, the most famous museums in the world all charge a fee from visitors.   To sum up, there are more advantages than disadvantages to charging an entry fee from visitors. Of course, the cost of visiting a museum will increase if there is an entry fee but most people will still be able to afford them. Better still, with the entry fee collected from visitors, museums can provide better experience which will encourage more and more people to pay a visit.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Environmental problems are clearly something that is often discussed in today’s world. One part of the society claims that individuals should change their habits and lifestyle to improve the ecological situation. Others, on the other hand, believe that this issue should be solved on the governmental level. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument and my perspective will be offered.It is hard to deny that human kind is responsible for the current environmental situation, and it seems impossible to achieve any noticeable result in this field without the participation of vast majority of individuals. For instance, a simple lifestyle change such as introducing the separation of household rubbish can make recycling projects more convenient and efficient. Moreover, consumers can reduce their usage of plastic items and, in turn, less plastic waste will contaminate the environment.However, many people still feel that the government has more tools to prevent environmental changes. One option that the authorities have is to discourage citizens from using personal vehicles by charging high taxes and additional fees. Moreover, politicians usually have access to resources to educate people about environmental problems and promote the most important ecological projects on all levels, ranging from special courses at schools to TV shows and websites related to this topic. Furthermore, it is a key responsibility of the government to protect the environment by spending state funds on research and modern equipment. Countries where legislation protects the ecology, for example Norway, have achieved visible results and overcame most environmental problems.In conclusion, I believe that a combined approach will work best to prevent or reverse environmental changes. A contribution of every individual is just as important as the intervention from the government in order to fix existing issues and save our planet for future generations.",8,False,120.67081447963801,294
"Should this tendency be changed ? Nowadays, in some tertiary education institutions , girls like to study arts subjects such as literature while boys desire to learn science subject such as physics. This might be because of the physical demands that involve science subjects. However, this trend should be changed as it is not a scientific approach. To begin with, it is true that in some higher education institutions girls opt to study arts subjects and boys prefer science subjects. The reason for this is that science subjects involve some physical demands such as carrying out experiments that last for months and years . so boys find these kinds of subjects very interesting . on the other hand, girls believe that arts subjects are suitable for them because they love recreational subjects more than boys do. For instance, a survey in Sudan in 2016 found that around 80% of girls interviewed said they lean toward art subjects because they require less physical demands. However, this phenomena should be changed because it is not based on any scientific study and thus it does not make any sense. There are many studies which found out that girls outperform boys in science subjects such as biology, chemistry and physics. This clearly shows that they are better than boys in science subjects. So it is very important to encourage girls and boys alike to choose subjects based on their desires and abilities rather than based on gender line. To sum up, both genders opt what to study at some universities and school based on their genders. This could be attributed to the nature of subjects, but I strongly believe that this trend should be changed as it does not have any scientific base. Get your writing samples corrected by us.

"Some parents believe that children should go to school; others feel that they should be taught at home. In my opinion, going to school is more beneficial for children than being taught at home. There are a number of reasons why parents think that teaching children at home is the best way of schooling. Firstly, they believe that when children are taught at home they will not be influenced by the ideologies such as religious beliefs or political preferences that most schools usually have. Secondly, some adults feel that children could benefit from learning specialised subjects that suit their skills. Lastly, some people often agree that teaching children at home is more practical and cheaper than sending them to a school, as this helps to save not only money but also time. On the other hand, there are some strong reasons to believe that schools are a much better place to educate children. To begin with, at school children are taught by experts and this helps them to improve in an overall and integral way. Another reason is that children will socialise and interact with other children coming from different backgrounds and this will help them to broaden their minds as well as develop respect for others. A final reason is that children would not only improve important skills such as team work and leadership, but also learn about values like friendship and responsibility. To summarise, the advantages of attending a school outweigh the advantages of studying at home. The most important thing that must be considered, regardless of the option, is that children must be taught with tolerance, respect and love.",7,False,62.58593855427107,272
"The trend of shopping as a leisure activity has emerged in recent times. Nowadays, people spend their free time either in shopping malls or on e-commerce websites. This essay will discuss various causes and effects of this development on individuals and the society. To embark on, there are several reasons why shopping has become a popular activity. First and foremost, the majority of companies give different kinds of offers and discounts on their products in order to attract customers. For example, it should be noted that big corporate houses tie-up with credit card vendors and banks. They provide many cash back offers on different products and sometimes they offer zero interest EMI schemes to lure consumers. As a result, people get mini loans without interest rates and this encourages them to buy products even if they do not need them. In addition to this, it can be seen that many e-commerce websites use data analytics techniques to know about the preferences of people and then they show advertisements of various offers on that particular product to attract customers. For instance, Amazon, an online shopping website, records the pattern of customer shopping habits and then uses this information to lure them into buying more. People are becoming shopaholic. This development has affected the society positively and negatively. It should be noted that this trend has increased the number of sales and profits of companies which in turn lead them to open new factories and warehouses to meet the increasing demands. As a result, people get more job opportunities. On the flip side, due to over shopping people are facing unnecessary burdens of debt. They spend a big chuck of their earnings to pay off personal loans and EMIs. Consequently, they have no money to save. To conclude, I personally feel that people are addicted to shopping and they buy even products they do not want and put undue pressure on themselves. Corporate houses are grabbing the hard earned money of individuals by using smart marketing strategies and becoming richer. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Many people believe that free community libraries are not in much use in the modern era of computers. Hence according to them maintenance of these libraries is a waste of resources. I completely disagree with this view as public libraries help people who cannot afford money for the internet. Additionally, it is difficult to verify whether online information is real or fake. On the one hand, several lines of evidence suggest that public libraries help many people to gain knowledge and information. To begin with, there are many students who are not able to spend money for personal computers and hence use libraries to get knowledge and information. Furthermore, community libraries are the cheapest source of information for everyone. Also in rural areas where internet access is still limited, public libraries are the source of information for students. On the other hand, the internet is not a reliable source of information. Firstly, there is too much information available on the internet which makes it difficult for students to differentiate between fake and real information. Also, just about anyone can post anything on the internet. There is no one to verify the veracity of content posted by online users. Consequently, chances of coming across false or harmful information on the internet are pretty high. To conclude, although the internet has made the information readily available, books are still the most trusted source of information as they are written by well known academicians and researchers. Hence, the government should continue to spend money on the maintenance of public libraries as these are important sources of knowledge. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Almost everyone uses social networking sites like Facebook these days. Some people are convinced that social networking has significantly more negative than positive impact on our lives. I completely agree with this view.  First and foremost, social networking has led to an increase in incidents of crimes. It gives even complete strangers access to the personal details of a person such as their locality, place of work etc. This is because social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram etc. encourage the public to share their day to day activities with their friends on their network. Although it feels good to share the happenings in your life with your mates by doing so online users are making it easy for fraudsters to access their personal information. Additionally, criminals can launch cyber attacks on their victim.  Another point to consider is the decline in human interactions. To illustrate, because of the flexibility that social networking provides like communication via chat, video calling, conference calls etc. it brings laziness to individuals. As a result, they hesitate to meet people in person. Unfortunately, lack of face to face interactions hurts relationships and leads to social alienation.  To sum up, although it sounds exciting to be part of social media and to share our whereabouts with friends, colleagues etc, it brings more concerns that need to be handled very well. Otherwise, it could have a significant negative impact on an individual and the society.  I believe that one should be very much aware of the issues that social networking brings before starting to use it.

"Celebrities often convey their opinions on general topics. Sometimes it is not good for the public. However, in my opinion, when celebrities talk about common issues, they help create awareness among the public and it is largely good.  To begin with, due to their popularity famous persons’ opinions reach the audience quickly. In addition, celebrities have mass appeal. Thus it is good when they voice their opinions because it helps the issue reach more people.  In addition to that many people, especially youngsters, blindly trust their role models and pay attention to them and follow their way. Because of this reason when celebrities talk about social issues, they help mobilize public support. In a developing country like India where more than half of the population constitutes youngsters, the opinions of celebrities have huge impact.  However, discussing public issues is not the job of a celebrity and oftentimes they are not qualified to do so. Also, it is better if well-known people keep their mouth shut on controversial topics that might instigate violence in the society. For example, if an actor gives an opinion in favour of his religion, it can upset followers of other religions. In the worst case scenario, this might even lead to violence. Therefore, famous people should consider public interest when they give their opinions. In conclusion, although giving opinion on general topic is not the job of a celebrity, I believe that they should express their views in order to create awareness.

"University education has become a luxury for people from poor and rural backgrounds. I believe that universities ought to help these people by making it easy for them to get admission. This would help to improve the economy of a country and help the individual to secure a better job. Well educated individuals can act as a catalyst to enrich the economy of a country. Education is one of the basic building blocks for the upliftment of the society. More educated individuals means more innovative minds. However, not everyone can realize their full potential with only primary and secondary education, whereas university education could pave the way to attain superior knowledge. For instance, a research conducted by the Boston Consulting says that a country’s economy is directly proportional to the literacy rate. So, universities ought to make the enrollment process easier for students from rural areas by eliminating complicated processes. Tertiary education can help a person to get a lucrative job, whereas elementary education can only help an individual to secure a menial job. With the advancement in technology our jobs have become more demanding than ever. A highly skilled workforce is required to work on cutting edge technologies. If a person does not have a university education, it will be difficult for him or her to get into a high paying job or work in sophisticated environments. Furthermore, people from poor background cannot afford university education so universities should provide scholarships for their betterment To recapitulate, I believe that without a university education it would be difficult for a person to secure a well-paid job and contribute to the economy. Hence, universities ought to make the enrolment process easier, especially, for the underprivileged students by ensuring that the bar is not set too high.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"There has been an increase in the number of crimes committed by criminals once they are out of the prison. This is mainly happening because the laws are not stricter and I believe stricter punishments should be enforced to deal with this problem. The reason why offenders repeatedly commit crime is that laws are not stringent in many countries. These criminals easily find the loop holes in the legislations and utilize those to come out of the jail. As a result, they are not afraid to commit the crime again, thinking that they can easily get off. For instance, in India, many criminals commit crimes but they roam free within a few days of getting convicted. Thus it is clear that the loopholes in legislation are the main reason offenders commit crimes more often. The best way to reduce the crime rate is for governments to impose stricter punishments on the criminals. This action creates a sense of fear among those who commit premeditated crimes. If they realize the consequences, they will never try to commit crime again. Take the UAE, for example, where punishments, such as stone pelting and hanging to death in front of the public are so common and this immensely helped to curb the crime rates. This nation has recorded the lowest crime figures compared to any other nation in the world. To conclude, the crime rate is definitely on the rise because of the weaker laws existing in practice, but this problem can be significantly reduced, if governments award capital punishments for the offenders. I hope in the future crime rates will be reduced and the world will be a better place to live in.",8,False,64.15604128718883,280
"Thanks to the invention of newer communication technologies we can now interact with just about anyone with perfect ease. Of course, technology has had both positive and negative impact on our interactions and relationships, but in my opinion, the overall impact is largely positive.  The spectrum of modern innovative means of interactions such as Facebook, Twitter, email, and the mobile phones allows us to connect to people instantly. We are in position to talk to a relative, to order a transaction or submit an application from the comfort of our home. The benefits of such interactions are enormous. First of all they save time. Secondly, at a time of need or emergency valuable help is at our doorstep. More importantly, we have access to more information to facilitate a transaction by the possibility of contacting a source or side. All of these are beneficial for us. However, there are negative aspects to this type of communication. Most importantly, this media may allow us to relate to people whose backgrounds are unknown to us. Most importantly, new age media enables us to connect with people whose backgrounds are unknown to us. It is important to understand that many people assume fake identities online. Another impact of such interactions is that we get isolated from the society. We may have numerous online friends and we are busy connecting with them, but we forget our immediate friends and neighbours.  Despite the drawbacks, today our lives are so enmeshed in this communication that it is impossible to survive without these means of interactions. More importantly, we are in a position to weed out useless or harmful information if we want to. To conclude / On balance, it is my opinion that the overall benefits and the advantages of these relationships we build in the cyber world are more positive than negative.         Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to some people, the rise in the use of internet based communication tools and text messages will result in the demise of face to face communication. I strongly agree with this view. In my opinion, the latest forms of communication will eclipse traditional methods soon. Internet based communication is becoming more and more popular because it is quick and reliable. Since internet networks are now available in all parts of the world, people can communicate with their friends, family and clients scattered across the world at any hour of the day. Also internet communication is possible in many different ways. For example, we can send an email or engage in a video chat.  In other words, the latest system of communication has made life much easier with useful features like inexpensive video chatting with family and friends. For example, I use Skype every evening to chat with my parents in India.  Another benefit is that the instant communication tools of of the modern era eliminate the need to travel long distances to have an interaction or deliver a message. Thus, it can be considered economic too and highly suitable for business and education needs. As face to face interactions may require travelling and meeting at a certain place, they are a time consuming process, which is unsuitable for the requirement of the modern life where one needs to do more in less time. Hence, the age old face to face chat is now considered almost obsolete and is used limitedly. To exemplify, now a trader in a country can buy products from a vendor in another continent through a simple email without ever seeing each other’s face which makes their business transactions quicker and boosts their trades. In conclusion, the use of modern technology has grown substantially leading to frequent use of video calls, emails, text messages and voice mails and minimised the time and effort required for in-person communication. This trend suggests that it will certainly replace face to face chat in near future. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate?

"People usually live in either houses or apartments. There are a certain group of people who believe that staying in a house is better than staying in an apartment because houses are more spacious and are often located in quiet areas. However, the disadvantages of living in houses are that unlike apartments, houses require more maintenance and the owner is the only person responsible for it. Also, security can be an issue if you live in a standalone house on a large plot. Even so, in my opinion, the advantages of living in a house outweigh the disadvantages.  It is agreeable that apartments are usually located in the city and have easy access to grocery stores, public transport and restaurants. For instance, when I was living in an apartment in New York I had three grocery stores located in the same block, subway was a 2 minute walk from the building and all the pubs were less than 15 minutes away by cab. Additionally, there are at least two apartments on each floor so it was easier for me to connect with my neighbors if I needed them. However, this is the exact opposite in the case of houses as there is quite a distance between two houses and one generally has to rely on private transport or cab to get about / to move about. On the other hand, houses have larger area than apartments. They have space for gardens, porches, swimming pools and garages, which provide for a more comfortable living. Another advantage of residing in a house is that it is located in remote areas and is away from the hustle-bustle of the city. Recent studies revealed that people living in houses are less prone to stress-related diseases because they are more relaxed.  In conclusion, while living in a house certainly has some downsides, it provides people with a relaxed and calm lifestyle along with abundant living space. Thus, in my opinion living in houses has more advantages than staying in apartments. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Going for an interview is an exciting as well as an anxious journey. Many employers begin the interview by asking about the personal details of the candidate to make them calm and relaxed. Some individuals believe that it is important to ask such questions because it helps to understand more about the candidate; however, some believe that the information has no use.  Asking personal questions reveals many details about the candidate which is not written in the resume. Questions related to hobbies give more insight into the person. For example, if the vacancy is for the post of a teacher and the candidate says that their favourite pastime is reading, it will leave a positive impression on the recruiter. Interests and hobbies disclose the personality of an individual to a great extent. Sometimes knowing a little more personal details of a candidate can give a clue of his/her future plans to the recruiter which helps them to decide further in the selection process.  On the flip side, many people think that personal information has no relevance while selecting a candidate for a role. Personal details can be fabricated to impress the interview committee and can lead to the collection of false information. In some cases, it can also be used against the candidate. Hence, in their opinion, it is better to ask questions related to the job profile, academic knowledge and work experience of the candidate.  In conclusion, while it is true that the personal information collected during an interview can be false and in certain situations, it can be used against the candidate, personally, I believe that there is nothing wrong with the practice of asking personal questions during an interview. Such questions create a friendly atmosphere between the interviewer and the interviewee and help the latter answer questions more clearly and confidently. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to some people, small businesses should not hire young women who are yet to have babies so as to prevent them from claiming maternity leave in future.  I firmly disagree. This is unfair to young women who want to be independent and is against the concept of equal opportunity for all. A good reason to disagree with the idea of not recruiting young women is that it is against the fundamental principle of equality. People regardless of their gender and family background ought to have equal employment opportunities. Gender biases in the recruiting process will push the society backward. One of the reasons that prevent women from starting a family is financial liabilities. They need a job to be able to stand on their own feet and provide for their kids. By choosing not to hire childless young women, employers are denying them the opportunity to earn and become independent.  Not hiring young women will be a great loss to the company.  Many independent, talented young women, particularly in big cities, prefer to live alone and focus on their careers. However, at some point in their lives they want to start a family and later continue following their passion for work. Refusing to hire these talented, focused women would be a huge loss for the business. In conclusion, I disagree with the idea of not employing young women just because they do not have their own family and might need maternity benefits later on.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"More and more students are taking a year off after completing school and before going to university. This can help them to prepare for university studies in advance but there are drawbacks to be taken into account. On the one hand, taking time off after finishing school can help students to prepare for university entrance exams. In other words, students can prepare for competitive exams to get admission in top universities. For instance, it is very common in India for students to take one year off after higher secondary to prepare for entrance exams of elite universities. Another benefit of this is that students can prepare for their university course in advance. As a result, the students will get an extra edge when they do / pursue graduation. Ultimately, their academic grades will be better which will help them to get a good job. On the other hand, there are several drawbacks to having a year off. One of them is the wastage of time. If a student loses focus while preparing for university entrance exam or courses, he will waste his whole year. Moreover, a lot of employers prefer to have candidates without any gap in education or work experience. Therefore, people with a gap year find it difficult to get a job as they have to justify their gap time to the potential employers.

"The issue of whether or not children should be engaged in some paid work has sparked a heated debate. While some argue that having some employment experience is conducive to a child’s learning and development, I contend that it would bring harm to the child’s  and learning.First of all, a workplace designed for adults  normally  child-friendly facilities. Desks and chairs are too high for a child; the light switches are installed on the walls unreachable  children; also emergency training and facilities such as phones are only provided to adults. Furthermore, various hazards such as polluted air and chemical fumes are still produced in factories and farms. Undoubtedly young people would suffer in such workplaces.Also, children would find it frustrating when they are not properly inducted before starting a job. A child working in a cement factory would feel a setback when he could not get immediate support while struggling with the procedures of recording different raw materials that  required by the job. Further, without sufficient support, a child’s misunderstanding or inappropriately communicating with adults would only disappoint him and prevents him from active learning and interacting with other people.To conclude, a child’s paid employment experience would lead to a negative impact on their health and active learning. However, recognizing the importance of children’s learning and their awareness of responsibility, it is advisable to encourage them to be involved in some volunteering opportunities where they can meaningfully learn and interact with other people with sufficient care and support in place for such jobs.",8,False,87.11111111111111,252
"Discuss both sides of view and give your opinion. Some people argue that politicians have the utmost impact on the world; however, others disagree. In their opinion, scientists are the most influential people on the planet. I agree with this latter group. In this essay, I will explain why I think scientists are more influential than politicians. There is no denying the fact that politicians are influential. After all, they rule the nations of the world. They make laws. They sign international agreements. They can even decide whether we need war or peace. Take, for instance, the case of the World Wars. While the wars were fought by the soldiers, the decision to go to war was taken by politicians. Obviously, the argument that politicians are influential is understandable. Yet, in my opinion scientists are more powerful. We wouldn’t have reached where we are today without the advancements in science and technology. Scientists have invented life saving drugs and vaccines which gave us a chance to stand up to deadly diseases. They invented the light bulbs, the automobiles, refrigerators and computers. As we can see, it is impossible to imagine a life without these inventions now. The missiles and bombs that can win a war for politicians were also invented by scientists. So, if there weren’t any scientists, we would most probably still be living in caves. The impact of politicians on our lives is negligible when we consider the impact of scientists and their inventions.

"Reading books on electronic devices such as tablets and smart phones is becoming increasingly popular. On the one hand, some feel that this change is a positive one, but on the other hand, people see this as a negative development. This essay will discuss the advantages and disadvantages associated with this trend. The biggest advantage of eBooks is that they can be stored and carried around easily/conveniently. Thousands of e-books can be stored on electronic devices such as tablets and smartphones which are no bigger than the size of your palm and therefore, people can carry their entire library with them wherever they go. A survey by the New York Times reported that more than 70 percent of the University students prefer e-books as they can now carry a single device containing an array of digital books in their pockets instead of a huge backpack filled with paper / hardcover books.  On the flip side, people feel that the over-reliance on electronic devices for reading puts a strain on the reader’s eyes. This is because tablets and smartphones emit blue light from their screens which causes stress and irritation to the eyes upon prolonged exposure. Ophthalmologists have found that more than half of the patients who visit them face issues with their eyesight primarily due to the excessive usage of electronic devices for reading purpose. Therefore, people need to take precaution while relying on reading books on their gadgets. Also, software glitches or a weak battery can make these devices useless and reading impossible. Since this can happen at the most inopportune times, it is not safe to rely on eBooks alone. To conclude, the major benefit of e-books is the convenience of carrying a vast number of files on a single device that people can access anywhere. Despite the advantages of this trend, it has the drawback of affecting the reader’s eyesight. Also, any problem with the eBook reader can make the books inaccessible.

This essay will elaborate on the same in the following paragraphs with relevant examples. To begin with, electronic gadgets like mobile phones and laptops provide people the convenience to watch performances and live shows from anywhere and anytime. Needless to say, they can be operated easily and the volume of the performance can be adjusted to an individual’s preference / liking. For instance, an extensive research conducted by the University of Oxford reported that there is a substantial increase in the number of people watching shows on their screens. The source also mentioned that this trend will continue to flourish in the future. Secondly, spending time on laptops to watch a show is a cost-effective way when compared to attending a live show that charges quite a lot of money for entry. In addition, there is no need to spend money on the commute if someone chooses to watch a show on his laptop rather than travel miles to the venue.  To conclude, watching entertainment programs on phones and laptops is not only convenient but also economical. Do you have an essay on this topic?

In other words children will be spending money on anything they want or . Even some adults these days have some kind of craving to the thing  If financial education starts at the very beginning of the school years, this will help them to understand the value of money. Children should also be taught to manage their expenses and ways to spend wisely.

"It is often said that in primary schools, the value of various art subjects is equivalent to that of other subjects. I totally agree with this opinion and I will show how such subjects can help children to discover their talents and fight boredom. One of the advantages of teaching such subjects at primary school is that it helps children to discover their true talents at an early age itself. This is because when students are studying at primary level their brains are more receptive to new ideas. This means if they start earlier, they will become competent professionals when they turn into adults. Learning art subjects also help children combat boredom. Few kids have a natural interest in academic subjects. Also they have short attention spans. When ‘boring’ subjects like maths or science are taught along with ‘interesting’ subjects like dance or painting, learning becomes easier for children. Art subjects also help with normal mental development of children. This is because art forms deal with various emotions and through songs, dance and paintings students can express those emotions constructively. They make children articulate.  In conclusion, due to the significance of these subjects in children’s professional and personal development, I firmly assert that these subjects should be taught in primary school.

"Some people believe that organizations should employ people who are creative and are able to work without supervision while others feel that it is more important to hire an obedient team player. I am of the opinion that companies should hire a good mix of personalities in order for them to flourish. On the one hand, creative and independent individuals can help to improve many aspects of the company as they may have a different or novel approach to handling their tasks. For example, they may be able to spot efficiency gaps in a workflow that has been established / has been followed for ages and could suggest something different to make it better and faster. Such input not only revolutionizes that particular task, but it could also help to shorten and improve the workflow of many in the grander scheme of things. On the flipside, it is equally vital that organizations hire staff with collaborative and pleasant characteristics as these people make the environment much more comfortable and harmonious. While innovation is invaluable, companies should also give equal importance to building a strong team. This can only happen with the right mix of people that know the weight of being able to follow instructions given by their superior and play their respective role as a team member. In a nutshell, I believe that no organization should favour any one type of personality while hiring people. Each company should seek out the right mix of people during their screening process in order to create an eclectic combination that could propel them to greater heights. After all, having too much of one type may be detrimental to a company’s culture.     Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"People have been taking pride in their culture by wearing ethnic attires since antiquity. However, modernization has transformed the world these days and people wear various garments and do not give importance to traditional clothes. Owing to this, cultural symbols are gradually diminishing and individuals, as well as societies, are getting impacted. Hence, it is a negative trend as people are getting detached from their own culture and society. In the bygone eras, people usually wore traditional attires that distinguished them from other cultures. Hence, it is evident that these clothes represent our culture. If the significance of these garments is lost then culture will be affected. For example, now-a-days many people from East India do not wear sarees and dhotis on the occasion of the ‘Makar Sankranti’ festival, which is one of the famous festivals of that region. As a result, the indigenous culture has started fading away and soon it will become history. Hence, although we can wear different kinds of clothes as per our wish and convenience, we should respect our culture by wearing ethnic clothes more often so that this ethnicity will pass down to the next generations. Moreover, there are other negative implications to this, which impact) the attitudes of an individual and society. Undoubtedly, traditional clothes bring positive vibes and light up / brighten our moods. Moreover, people feel a sense of belonging to a particular community when they are in their respective ethnic. In other words, it binds a society as one and gives it unique characteristics. Lack of this certainly disintegrates the society and people will lose their individuality. For example, a popular attire ‘Mekhla-Sador’ gives a unique identity to Assamese women. Hence, wearing traditional garments is imperative for an individual as well as a society. To recapitulate, in this contemporary era, traditional clothes are losing their importance due to globalization. It is a negative trend as it affects the society as well as individuals by making them lose their originality.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Firstly the work from home culture brings various monetary benefits to the employer. When an employer arranges a workplace for an individual, they have to bear the facilitation cost for him. Also when employees work from their home, the company does not have to make arrangements for their transport. Owing to this, the overall cost of running an office comes down. Secondly, work from home enables employees to save time. This time can be utilized for office work or for the family. Additionally, all the employees can start their day at the same time and can be more productive. Lastly, working from home saves valuable resources. Less commuting means less travel and less load on transport systems. There can be significant savings in terms of the fuel. Moreover, electronic media usage will result in less paper wastage. All this can help in reducing the overall carbon footprint. On the contrary, not working from office may hamper the team harmony. It can also hamper the individual’s efficiency as they may not get instant support. However an efficient management can easily take care of these issues. All in all, working from home brings in myriads of benefits to the society. Employers have already started realizing these advantages and in the future, we will surely have more organizations taking this route. Disclaimer This essay is written by one of our students.

"Nowadays, people spend a lot of money to build homes and offices. One of the first things that they consider while constructing buildings is their design. In my opinion, the design of a building can have both positive and negative impact on people.  Engineers design buildings according to the vision of the residents. They ensure optimal ventilation because airflow inside the buildings can affect the cognitive function in humans. Study rooms, for example, should be airy because it helps to stimulate their brain. As a result, the grasping power and concentration of students can be increased. By contrast, if the buildings are not properly ventilated, residents may develop various health problems and depression. Ultimately, this situation affects their personal and professional lives. Office buildings should make optimal use of space because employees spend 8 to 10 hours in the workplace and the design of the building should ensure their comfort. In addition, office spaces should induce relaxation. One way of achieving this is to incorporate relaxing colours like green in the design. Green rooms, for example, have a soothing effect on employees and help them work with greater efficiency. It is also important for homes and offices to make best use of natural sunlight. This will reduce the operating cost of these buildings by eliminating the need for artificial lighting during day time. Safety is another important concern. The design of buildings should meet the safety measures as described by the government so that buildings do not pose a threat to the lives of people. In the case of buildings built in areas prone to earthquakes or hurricanes, it is important to ensure that they are protected against these natural disasters. In conclusion, the design of buildings certainly affects the wellbeing of residents. While building homes and offices, it is important to ensure optimal use of air and sunlight. It is also important to meet construction guidelines relevant to the area.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Nowadays youngsters enjoy playing video games and as a result, they spent a great deal of time on their computers. Although playing video games has a negative effect on their physical and emotional growth and development, it has a few benefits too. Hence, I can only partially agree with the given argument that video games are harmful for children.  Playing videos games excessively can hurt the physical and sociological development of children in numerous ways. Firstly when young children are addicted to playing video games they spent a lot of time sitting in front of their computers and they may hardly do other physical activities. Due to this situation, young people may not receive adequate exercise and they may become obese. In addition, this addiction to playing these games prevent children from going out to socialize with their friends and play other games such as football and hockey, which provide exercise to the body. Due to this, these youngsters may not be able to make friends in the society or engage in any social activity, which may help to build the social network they may require in future to be a successful person. Furthermore, many video games have violent content and children playing them may demonstrate aggressive and antisocial behaviour. Hence playing video games can be harmful for youngsters both socially and physiologically.  On the other hand, playing these kinds of games can also benefit them. Some video games enhance the creativity of children and enable them to take quick decisions in emergency situations. A good example is the specially designed pilot training software. Moreover, some video games allow playing in teams and they may be helpful to make a virtual network of friends.  In conclusion, playing video games can be harmful to the physical and sociological development of children by making them obese and antisocial even though these games can improve their decision-making abilities and creativity.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Thanks to advancements in modern technology, people can now work from anywhere including their homes. In my opinion, this is a beneficial trend and it should be encouraged. Working from home benefits both the employer and the employee. Most employees who work from their home use their own equipment for getting the work done. This arrangement benefits the employer because they do not have to invest in costly hardware or furniture. They can also save money on rentals and utility bills. The low operational costs will ultimately increase the profit of the organisation. In addition, when organizations allow employees to work from home at a time convenient to them, they can reduce attrition to a great extent. The biggest benefit for employees is the time savings. On average, employees in large cities spend two to three hours a day for the daily commute. When they work from their home, they can save this time and use it for other activities. For example, they can spend more time with their family or pursue a hobby. Studies have shown that employees who get enough time for themselves are actually more productive and happier. Working from home also benefits young women who quit their jobs to take care of their children. Most of them will readily return to work if they have the opportunity to work flexible hours from their home. To conclude, not only employees but businesses also benefit when they allow their workers to work from home. In my opinion, more organizations should realize the benefit of this practice and promote it.",9,False,79.44501875662209,261
"Nurturing a child is not a cakewalk. It involves intense hard work and dedication of both parents. It is often argued that parents should take up child care lectures to train themselves in proper rules of parenting. In my opinion, in the current scenario of nuclear families, this seems a favourable approach. To begin with, family structure has changed over the years. Earlier people used to live in joint families with their parents and under the supervision of the elders child care used to be an easy task. However, nowadays people live away from their family due to work or other commitments. This makes it difficult to bring up a child. Therefore, new parents-to-be are usually advised to undergo baby care training which helps relieve some of the anxiety of the newborn’s parents. These courses not only educate about the feeding patterns of the baby at various stages but also make the parents cognizant about ways to tackle any emergency related to the infant. This enables parents to efficiently nurture their child even in the absence of elderly relatives. Concomitantly, for the holistic development of the child, parents should not depend only on the teacher. Children learn a lot from interaction with their parents. Hence, parents should take an extra step and provide the desired education to their children at home. If the mother is not working, she can take up homeschooling training and educate her child at home in an amiable environment. Rather than sending the child off to the school at a very tender age, home schooling is a safer option for the initial formative preschool level. To conclude, I firmly reiterate that although parenthood is something that is natural ,in the present-day conditions it is conducive if the parents have some sort of training in child care for the better upbringing of their progeny.

"When someone succeeds, people often attribute that to luck. While I admit that luck may have a role to play here, I don’t know anyone who achieved success only because of luck. Therefore, I disagree with the argument that success or failure is a matter of good or bad luck. If we look around it is not hard to see that most people who achieved success in life had faced many hardships in their early life. Apple INC’s Steve Jobs, for example, was given up for adoption immediately after he was born. He faced hardships in his early life but went on to found one of the most enduring businesses in the world. Steve Jobs never attributed his success to luck. Neither did Bill Gates, the richest man in the world. They were visionaries who toiled hard to win their goals. Helen Keller, whose story continues to inspire millions of people even today, didn’t even have many faculties that we take for granted. She could neither hear nor speak but none of these disabilities prevented her from achieving what she wanted in life. There are several such examples of people who fought against all odds to achieve their goals. Many of them came from backgrounds that we consider unlucky. Still through determination, dedication and hard work they were able to achieve success, fame and money. Of course, there are a few people who achieved success because of good luck. Children born to rich and famous parents, for example, do not have to struggle to become famous or rich. We can perhaps attribute their success to luck but in reality such success does not last long. To conclude, if a person is determined to succeed nothing, not even bad luck, can prevent them from achieving what they want. Fortune, after all, favours the brave.",9,False,89.5279418446161,303
"Some people believe that parents are responsible for developing good eating habits in children while others opine that it is the duty of teachers. In my opinion, this duty should be assumed by the parents.  Children these days are not careful about their eating habits as they are more prone to eating unhealthy foods such as burgers, chocolates and cakes. Such habits should be controlled by the parents before kids become addicted to junk food. Since the children spend most of their time at homes, I believe parents should be extra careful when it comes to their child’s eating habits. In other words they should create and follow a diet plan and strictly adhere to it so that the child receives optimum nutrition essential for his/her growth and development. For example, children can be given fresh fruits as their snacks at home rather than cookies and chocolates. However, this does not mean that parents are the only people responsible for teaching good eating habits. It is essential that the teachers should also play a key role in teaching them about healthy lifestyle and make them understand so that they embrace / adopt the healthy habits in their day to day life. Teachers can give them an understanding of the importance of fruits and veggies and make them realize how healthy children can be by consuming them. For example, they can arrange a one day visit to the farms to teach children how the vital nutrients in fruits and vegetables keep them healthy.  In conclusion, both the parents and teachers should make an effort to ensure that children follow healthy eating habits. Even so, I believe that good eating habits start from home. If parents eat right, children will also adopt a healthy lifestyle and become fit.   Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"With the advent of the Internet, advertisements, originally displayed only on TV, billboards, posters and so on, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous and commonplace for the general public. In my view, this kind of impact could be both crucial and, on a certain level, detrimental.On the one hand, this phenomenon could denote that although we have already had a diverse range of , people are still capable of inventing innovative approaches catering for all kinds of requirements of advertising. It is a symbol that demonstrates the creativity rooted in human beings. Apart from that, it also represents that the speed of spreading information is conspicuously escalating. More purposeful is, therefore, the fact that, besides booming of the advertising, it constitutes a major reason why people could be so prosperous in this digital age.On the other hand, there are various unpleasant consequences as well. Firstly, with the omnipresent , it could potentially cause people to do impulsive shopping. Secondly, the , if regulated in a mismanaged , could make people constantly feel uncomfortable or annoyed. In this sense, instead of being an instrumental tool to promote amenities, advertisements could be considered a hindrance when people are frequently blocked by them. Furthermore, it would cost one precious time to have to sift the helpful ad from a host of others.In conclusion, as far as I am concerned, advertising is a beneficial phenomenon for all with a number of insignificant drawbacks. I believe that in the future we can improve the way advertising is done at present, and embrace the positive influence of advertising even further in the long run.",8,False,89.14288949275362,262
" I think that wealthy nations should be required to share their wealth with poorer nations.  at providing such things as food and education because of the three following reasons.

If there are no actions taken, this inequality will increase dramatically. Poor countries will become  poorer while rich countries will become  richer. As a result, the poorest countries will become slaves of the richest countries. So, sharing wealth is  useful way to prevent people from that bad future.Thirdly, although sharing wealth with poorer nations is very necessarythis help should only stop at providing such things as food, medicine and education.

Moreover, rich nations can take advantage of sharing wealth to interfere with the governance of poor nations’.

"According to some people, diet and exercise play no role in health and longevity. I certainly disagree with the statement, as a good diet and exercise regimen are of paramount importance in maintaining health. A nutritious diet plays a vital role in maintaining good health. Consumption of high calorie, unsaturated fats and high sugar containing drinks poses a serious threat to a person’s health and increases their chances of developing health problems such as obesity, diabetes and heart trouble. To avoid these health problems, it is important to follow a healthy diet consisting of green leafy vegetables, dry fruits, and extra lean meat. A balanced diet provides protection from various health problems and thus enhances the longevity of people. Meanwhile, exercise is as beneficial as a good diet. Working out every day can benefit the body in a great way. Exercise helps to keep the joints moving and increases the stamina to perform vigorous activities. It aids in digestion, sleep and elimination of toxins out of the body. In other words, it cleanses the body and provides relaxation. Therefore, exercise has many advantages that facilitate to keep the body in good shape. The need for medical assistance is also reduced and one can spend a disease free long life. In conclusion, while some people may vary in their views, I think everyone should incorporate exercise and healthy diet in their lifestyle to add more years to their life.

"People use portable mobile devices and laptop computers to watch and play films and games at any time of the day. In my opinion, there are more drawbacks than advantages to having constant access to movies and video games.  Admittedly, there are some basic advantages to using mobile devices and laptop computers anytime for entertainment. One of the minor advantages is that people can entertain themselves whenever they want. For example, people watch movies and play games while travelling on a bus or aeroplane. This helps people to stay engaged even when they have fewer options for other sources of entertainment. Another small benefit could be not having a feeling of loneliness. People who stay alone and who do not have many activities to do could potentially avoid the state of loneliness by using electronic devices for entertainment.   Despite the minor advantages written above, in my opinion, the uncontrolled use of electronic devices for entertainment has significant drawbacks. One of the significant problems is that many people, especially youngsters, get addicted to it. Young people keep themselves occupied with video games and movies in most of their free time. They do not have time for even physical activity and this affects their health adversely. Another major issue to consider is the lack of discipline in people to control and stop electronic entertainment, specifically for resting time. For instance, people use their devices to entertain themselves even at late night, which affects their sleep.  Not sleeping well for a long time potentially creates health issues.   In conclusion, drawbacks of having unrestricted access to entertainment using portable devices far outweighs any of the minor advantages it brings for people.

"Sports, by nature, involve intense competition and people often debate the factor which determines the outcome of a sports match. Some hold the opinion that supreme physical strength only those who possess a healthy mental attitude can be successful. In my opinion, physical abilities and the right mindset are equally important.  On the one hand, superior strength gives athletes an edge over their peers when it comes to physical confrontation. It is unavoidable that, in certain forms of sports, players have to physically collide with their competitors, and hence those who demonstrate greater strength are more likely to win / succeed. For example, in a boxing match which is noted as a strength-based game a stronger boxer normally has faster punching speed and higher punching power, which enable them to easily knock down their rivals. Another obvious advantage of a strong body is endurance. This is also a determinant factor in competition, especially in race matches. In sprint, for instance, greater endurance enables athletes to maintain their maximum speed for a long time and avoid fatigue.  On the other hand, an optimistic mindset is also of great importance. To be specific, in a fierce competition, especially when a player is falling behind, his stress levels will peak at a rapid speed. Without an optimistic mentality, he may “go blank” and / as the immense stress overtakes his ability to perform normally. However, if he had faith in himself, he would manage to ease the tension and focus on his movements. Furthermore, eminent athletes always have a winning mindset and a strong sense of purpose. Compared to those who are apathetic towards a match, players with these character traits always stick to rigorous training and a healthy diet; therefore by no means could these sedulous persons lose the game. In conclusion, fitness and spirit both play significant roles in being successful in sports. A strong body improves an athlete’s ability to confront physically, while without an optimistic mentality and and intense craving for success, no athlete can win.",8,True,103.76136961726922,335
"Within the span of a few thousand years, humans have gone from using tools made of rocks to living in the skyscrapers. It is often debated whether our accomplishments are more valuable than those of our ancestors. In my opinion, they certainly are. The truth is in the last fifty years alone, humans achieved a lot more than what our ancestors achieved in 5000 years.  The ancient man lived in the caves and had little understanding of the world outside. They used rocks to hunt animals. It took them centuries to learn the practice of farming. However, once they had enough to eat and a safe place to live in humans started making tremendous progress. Even today many things that they achieved remain a mystery to us. For example, we still do not know how the great pyramids of Egypt were built with the minimal tools available during that era. Furthermore, prehistoric humans managed to travel the globe without access to modern navigation systems such as GPS and state-of-the-art ships. To illustrate, early humans relied solely on the stars to guide them in their travel and they shaped tree trunks to produce vessels to carry them across the oceans. Of course, their achievements cannot be undervalued.  Yet, we have ample reasons to believe that the modern man has achieved a lot more. Today, the modern technology enables us to live a life better than what our forefathers lived. With the invention of the internet, we can now communicate with anyone regardless of their geographical location. For example, Skype enables families to have a live video conference call that feels like everyone is in the same room. This was not possible ten or fifteen years ago. Moreover, in the past, humans rarely managed to live past 30 or 40 years but today the average life expectancy in the developing and developed world is 70 years or above. People are now able to live much longer and healthier due to modern medicines and the knowledge of a better lifestyle. Obviously, modern technology enables us to enjoy many things that were not possible in the past. In conclusion, even though some achievements of our forefathers remain a mystery even today due to our lack of understanding of the early humans and their know-how, I strongly believe that today’s technology and our achievements are more valuable than what our ancestors achieved.

"The world witnessed a lot of diverse developments in the 21st century. One such important development is globalisation and it has influenced every aspect of life. Many people are excited about living in a globalized world, yet a few people believe that globalization is not beneficial. A careful analysis shows that globalisation has both merits and demerits. Globalisation offers us a plethora of merits. The most important one among them is the easy availability of services and products. It is because of globalisation, the services or products available only in selected countries are now available around the world. For example an Apple iPhone gets its motherboard and the phone body manufactured in USA and China respectively. This gets assembled in another country where it is sold. Globalisation has an additional advantage of increasing the employment opportunities in developing and under developed countries. Globalisation also helps to reduce the price of products by getting them manufactured in countries where the labour cost is low. On the flip side, the negative aspects of globalisation cannot be wished away / cannot be overlooked. It interferes with the tradition, culture and the way of living of a country in which it is implemented. Globalisation enables multinational companies to exploit the natural resources of poor countries. To consider an example, beverage companies established in India have their presence in river beds.

"It is indeed true that researchers have been issuing warnings about the importance of reducing our energy consumption and protecting the environment. While there are some reasons for the excessive consumption of electricity, I believe that people can be motivated to use less electricity by spreading awareness. One of the main reasons for the over-consumption of electricity is the advancement of technology. Most of the electrical appliances such as AC, washing machine and microwave are available at low-cost, so everyone can easily afford them. Also, these products make our life more convenient and comfortable; therefore, people have become more dependent on these and overuse electricity. Another reason for over usage of electricity is that every member of the family needs their own space. That is why everyone needs their room; thus, the number of electrical appliances in a house increases many folds with this trend. For instance, if there are five members in a family, they all will need a sperate AC, fan and TV. As a result, the usage of electricity increases with the increment in the number of electrical products.   People can be encouraged to buy products depending on the power consumption star rating mentioned on them. If a product has more star rating, it will consume less electricity. For instance, an AC with three star rating consumes two units in an hour whereas a five star AC consumes only one. In this way, people can decrease the over utilisation of electricity. Apart from that government can make people aware of the importance of conserving electricity by advertising and conducting campaigns about the depletion of natural resources used to produce electricity and also the side effects of emission of harmful gases to the environment that electrical appliances such as refrigerators and air conditioners emit. In conclusion, even though people overuse electricity as most of the electrical products are cheaply available, I believe that by making people aware and providing substitutes to the appliance that use more power, we can motivate people to use less electricity.",8,True,73.63852425824848,337
"It is true that many schools now have to contend with a lack of discipline among students. Some argue that teachers should play a vital role in enforcing discipline at school while others hold parents responsible for this. In my opinion, both parents and teachers have an equally important role in raising disciplined children. Over the years, schools are observing increased rate of acts of indiscipline by pupils. So, some people insist that since children spend most of their time in schools, teachers should play a crucial role in inculcating discipline in them. Furthermore, due to their influence, teachers can easily develop good manners in children. Also, due to the fear of being reprimanded or punished by teachers or the principal, children are more receptive to the teachings of discipline from teachers. On the other hand, others argue that teachers have other important tasks at school, so parents should primarily teach discipline to their wards. Also, most of the time children learn bad behaviour from home. Since parents don’t give them constant attention, they get the leeway to be mischievous at home. They may repeat the same behaviour at school. If parents enforce strict rules of discipline at home, this can be prevented to a great extent. What’s more, parents can appropriately punish their children without causing them too much distress whereas punishments from teachers can be embarrassing and may make a child rebellious. To conclude, it is evident that parents and teachers should share the responsibility of inculcating discipline in children.",7,True,75.8026969481902,252
"Cycling is no longer a popular mode of transportation. This is sad especially when we consider the fact that cycling is healthier than driving/ cycling offers many health benefits. This essay will discuss the possible reasons behind the decline in the use of bicycles and also suggest some ways to make them popular again. One of the main reasons for the declining popularity of cycling is the change in our lifecycle. With the advancement in modern technology, people have become lazy and dependent on motor vehicles. Little do they realize the value of physical exertion associated with cycling. To add to this, we do not have separate lanes for cyclists and consequently their safety is at risk. Also thanks to the addition of new features and comfort mechanism, modern bicycles are quite expensive. The price hike makes people reluctant to buy bicycles. There are various ways to encourage people to use bicycles. Firstly, the law enforcement agencies should focus on constructing separate lanes for cyclists. To reduce the number of automobiles on the roads, the government should impose a carbon tax on them. Secondly, the government should launch campaigns to create awareness about the health benefits of cycling. For instance, the government can promote the practice of cycling to work. In conclusion, I believe that cycling is no longer considered an exciting activity and its use has decreased steeply; but we can make it popular again by creating awareness about its health benefits. The government should also build separate lanes for cyclists.",8,True,69.18524340100525,252
"It is often thought by some people that children are given an excessive amount of free time and they think this time ought to be utilized to do more school work. I do not agree with this view.  To begin with, I think children should spend their free time playing games and engaging in other physical activities because they spend at least 6 to 8 hours at school and are given too much homework to do at their homes. This is because they need to stay fit and healthy throughout the year in order to study and obtain good grades.  To illustrate, recent studies conducted by the National Education Organisation revealed that children spending their free time on physical activities along with school work acquired higher grades than those spending all their time on school work. Moreover, when they play games with other children at the playground, they get a chance to meet different people with whom they can make friends and they can be stress-free. If children were to do school work in their free time, they would miss some crucial benefits like making friends with other people and being healthy.  There are other essential activities such as yoga, and other essential classes which should be imparted to children since they are bestowed with academic knowledge at the school itself. The reason for this is that they play a pivotal role in gaining general knowledge which is a must in today’s world. For instance, many children who spend most of their time on classroom work have less general knowledge than those who use their time for playing games and participating in other physical activities. If children allocate their free time to spend on these activities, they will definitely attain high grades and will be able to socialize with others later in their lives. In conclusion, even though children spending all of their time on school work can obtain some benefits, in my opinion, they can stay healthy and secure good grades and communication skills if they spend their free time on physical games and other activities.

"Many people migrate to foreign countries in search of better work and living environments. Living in such countries where you have to use an entirely unknown language leads to difficulty in social and practical scenarios. This essay will argue that although there are many issues arising from the language barriers, these are not so serious that they cannot be resolved. In my opinion, although language barriers may create many issues, these are not so serious that they cannot be resolved. The practice of shifting base to a new country is common amongst all classes of people. It is obvious that they will encounter problems when it comes to conversing with the local people and may also face similar issues at work. As they do not know how to speak the local dialect, their ability to socialise and perform various day to day activities will be hampered.  For example, shopping in the vegetable market may seem a huge task. Thus living in such countries where one ought to speak the country’s native language is certainly is certainly going to be challenging at least in the first few months. There are multiple factors that one must consider prior to moving to a new land. The factors will help to cope up with the language barrier. Prior to moving to a foreign land, one must prepare oneself for what lies ahead.  For example, before migrating to Germany where the majority speaks German, one must get acquainted with the basics of the language. In this age of the internet and online forums, learning a new language is easier than ever before. Taking help of one’s own compatriots living abroad is another way to overcome this problem.  In conclusion, I absolutely concur with the notion that living in another country where conversing in the local language is a must is troublesome, but this trouble is often short lived and brief and can be taken care of by making prior preparations and seeking help from the natives.

Moreover, we can affirm that  remains under the same codes. Maybe because of a religious view point, the respect for life is a typical value in the Old Catholic world.Those who are in favor of capital punishment mostly live in developing countries. However, this is not just an image of the Third World countries. Actually, the USA is one country where this kind of punishment has its  rates of application.

"It is argued that social media such as Facebook and Instagram have had many detrimental effects on both the people and the community. This essay totally agrees with this statement because social media deprives people of real human interaction and also exposes them to many psychological problems resulting from being addicts to these kinds of websites.  The main argument against social media websites is that they reduce face to face interaction between people. This is because nowadays most people use social media social media for communicating with one another instead of visiting them personally. As a result, people have lost empathy, and relationships have become weaker. For example, The New York Times has reported that 85% of the global population use social media to stay in touch with friends and family and show reluctance to call or meet them in person. Unfortunately, this leads to the disintegration of families and communities.  Furthermore, many people have become addicted to these sites. This is because the excessive use of social media makes people live in the virtual world, which can lead to many psychological diseases such as, depression and stress and other issues like loneliness. Many people are actually seeking treatment for social media addiction. Thus, it is evident that social media has a significant impact on how people live and socialize. In conclusion, I agree with the argument that social media has had many adverse impacts on individuals and societies by making real face to face interactions obsolete. In my opinion, it is important for people to realize this and reduce the amount of time spent on social networking sites. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Recent developments in the field of technology have revolutionized our lives tremendously. They have made our work and lifestyles easier and more luxurious than they used to be in the past. One such invention is the motor car, which has made travelling comfortable as well as time saving. However, some people believe that owning a car has more disadvantages. The following essay takes a look at both sides of the argument. In recent years, the number of people having a private car has increased drastically. There are plenty of benefits to owning a car. Travelling by a personal vehicle is much more comfortable and time saving than travelling by local bus and train services. Local services have many specific stops on their way to the destination which discomfort the passengers as well as consume their time. Moreover, when you travel by your own vehicle you can stop whenever you need a refreshment break during your journey. Another advantage is that people can carry as much luggage as they want while travelling in a private car. On the other hand, there are a few drawbacks to owning a private car. Nowadays with the enhanced number of cars on the road there are more traffic jams causing long delays. Also, a continuous increase can be seen in the cost of cars and fuel prices. Smoke released from these cars worsens air pollution and in turn causes plenty of health problems. To conclude, there are definitely many advantages and disadvantages to owning a private car; however, in my opinion, there are an equal number of disadvantages too. It is recommended that people should limit the use of private cars to only those situations when they cannot avoid it. Also, they should consider switching to cleaner sources of energy to reduce much of the pollution caused by private vehicles. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In this contemporary era, obesity has become a major concern among people. Some people believe that sports must be included in the tertiary education system. I strongly agree with this argument that sports should be made mandatory in colleges in order to make our younger generation healthier and more efficient.  One good reason to make sports compulsory is that students can achieve the minimum requirements / dose of their daily exercise at their college itself. Exercise / physical activity is indispensable for their overall health and academic performance.  For example, a recent study revealed that students who play sports in their colleges are smarter and more active in their studies. If children follow all the rules and regulations of games, they become more disciplined in their lives as well. Furthermore, students after graduating from these colleges tend to perform their job duties with discipline and show maximum efficiency at workplace.  Another positive outcome of mandatory sporting activities in the college curriculum is that this leads to fewer health problems among children. As a result of regular exercise, they tend to have stronger muscles and a healthy mind which makes them immune to disease carrying germs and other ailments like heart trouble, diabetes and obesity. Additionally, when young people engage in physical activity, their parents may also get motivated to exercise. Therefore, the whole society will benefit from this move.  In conclusion, the problem of overweight is a serious issue which can be effectively controlled by adding compulsory sport classes in all the college degrees. Playing games not only makes the youngsters physically healthy but also fosters the right attitude and mindset in them. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The wearing of school uniforms is an issue that is both supported and opposed by many people. Numerous schools around the world require students to wear school uniforms on their grounds, however, teachers are not often required to wear a specific uniform while working. It has therefore been suggested that it should be compulsory for teachers to wear a specific uniform or follow a specific dress code on a daily basis.One reason for introducing a dress code for teachers would be that teachers typically function as role models. For students who are not willing to conform to the dress code of their school, it would be beneficial to see figures of authority wearing the same outfit as each other, and they would then potentially be more willing to follow their own dress code.Another reason for introducing a compulsory dress code for teachers would be that if all teachers wore the same outfit, there would be no visible difference amongst them. Naturally some teachers are wealthier than others and would tend to show this through their clothing. This could cause other teachers to feel inferior and therefore could result in lower quality work and decreased motivation. Furthermore, students would feel treated more fairly, if not only they, but teachers as well had to wear a certain uniform in school.Lastly, uniforms for teachers would enable students and other teachers to easily distinguish between school staff and other adults. In many schools there is no high quality security system and strangers can easily enter and steal something or commit other crimes. If teachers wore uniforms, one would then be able to approach and confront strangers more easily, as one could distinguish teachers wearing uniforms clearly from other adults.In conclusion, there are many positive effects of introducing uniforms for teachers and therefore, in my opinion, they should be installed in as many schools as possible.",9,True,55.9484387197502,311
"Reading behaviour has been considerably affected by the internet revolution. Many individuals have shifted their reading behaviour toward digital and e-books, instead of the traditional printed books. In my opinion, this positive phenomenon will continue to grow as more book readers will adopt the new online reading methods; meanwhile, publishers and book stores will strive to find new strategies to survive. On the one hand, the increase in popularity of digital reading is influenced by the benefits that the internet can provide. Firstly, the internet eliminates the geographical boundaries and save considerable time. Now, readers behind their screens can choose their books, purchase and download them without waiting till the book is imported and arrive to their local book stores. Moreover, book readers have more freedom of choice, because digital books bypass the strict regulations on publications which are imposed by some governments. Secondly, e-books are more convenient than regular books. They are cheaper, as its save cost of printing, and shipping. Furthermore, online books can be either saved on the clouds or on the hard disk, which spare the physical spaces. On the other hand, book publishers and book stores will face considerable challenges since they continuously lose customers and market shares. They are obligate to find strategies to cope with the new trend of readers’ behaviours; otherwise, they will be out of the market. Many of large publishing companies and book stores have already transformed themselves into online book stores. However, local publishing and book stores will be disappeared, as they can not bear the cost of shifting into online stores. To sum up, I consider, the benefit of having online books is one of the best outcomes of the internet, and in the foreseeable future more people will shift into online reading.",7,True,61.100365702577776,295
"Thanks to advancements in communication technology, media now plays a crucial role in our lives. It has the ability to influence a large set of people within a short span of time. Television and the internet, for example, can provide live coverage of events happening all over the world. This unique ability of media makes it all too powerful because it can be used for both good and bad purposes.   Using media for good purpose is crucial. Due to its increased reach, media now wields greater power than in the past. It influences not only mature adults but also innocent children and hence it is crucial to share appropriate content. Studies have shown that media has a major impact on a child’s psychology. If children get exposed to violent or inappropriate content on television or the internet, it can affect their normal development.  Not only children but adults are also influenced by media content. For example, when media gives too much coverage to the opulent lifestyle of the rich and the famous, it is a sending a wrong message to the society. People get influenced and start aspiring to have a materialist life. Unfortunately, this can lead to the demise of age old values that made us what we are today. Another reason for serving content that promotes good will is that it has an overall positive impact on the society. For example, coverage of motivational stories and sports inspire people to do something beneficial with their lives. Media is also responsible for dispensing vital information in critical situations. For instance, in the event of a natural calamity or the outbreak of a major epidemic the media should make use of its reach and create awareness among people. This is crucial to save lives.  In conclusion, due to its massive reach media has tremendous influence on the society; however, it should take utmost care to ensure that good news gets more coverage.

"Most developing countries fail to grow beyond a certain level because of the lack of adequate infrastructure. Hence, some people argue that foreign assistance should be primarily used to tackle this problems. I partly with agree with this idea. While I do admit that infrastructure is important, it is not the only factor determining the success of a nation.  One of the main problems that plague developing and underdeveloped countries is the lack of adequate infrastructure. For example, many of them do not have a good network of roads or railways. Likewise, they do not have enough power supplies or water distribution systems. Needless to say, foreigners do not want to invest in such countries.  Infrastructure development requires a great deal of capital. Since poor countries cannot afford to invest that kind of money, they have to struggle with inadequate infrastructure. Unfortunately, this limits their growth prospects. Developed countries are unlikely to invest in developing countries that do not have good infrastructure. That explains why foreign investors are bullish on countries like China where they have excellent infrastructure conducive for growth. By contrast, few entrepreneurs want to invest in African countries where the infrastructure hardly exists. Needless to say, while China is on the path to growth, African nations are still struggling. Hence, the argument that foreign assistance should be primarily used for building infrastructure certainly holds some water.  Even so, it is preposterous to utilize the entire aid received from abroad for building infrastructure. Good infrastructure alone will not ensure the development of nation. Along with infrastructure, a nation needs healthy and educated citizens capable of giving back to the society. For this reason, it is important to invest in areas such as education and health. In addition to building schools and hospitals the government must ensure that quality education and healthcare are provided at these places for free or at affordable rates. Social welfare schemes should also be given a push.  In conclusion, I contend that infrastructure development is certainly important and a certain portion of the foreign assistance should be used for this purpose. However, it is equally important to invest in key human development areas such as education, healthcare and social welfare. Do you have an essay on this topic?

While hectic work and family commitments are often singled out as the possible causes, there are also other factors associated with it which definitely have viable solutions. To begin with, in this competitive era, man is already struggling to strike work-life balance. In this scenario to expect a person to find time for neighbours is forthrightly frivolous. Secondly, even if people get time, they prefer spending it indulging in their favourite leisure activities rather than socialising with people in the vicinity. In addition to that, children were often considered as connecting links between neighbours. With fewer children playing out together these days, the interaction between the parents has also declined. Furthermore, crime based serials has led people to distrust any new person in the neighbourhood. This further limits their interactions. On the bright side, there are many viable solutions to this problem. One possible solution is having a community centre or a club and organising weekly or monthly get-togethers. A committee should be formed with convincing and influential members who can motivate others to participate in these meetings. Moreover, parks and playgrounds should be constructed for children and adults to encourage them to relinquish the comforts of their home and interact with their neighbours. Although it is good to have a watchful eye after careful scrutiny a friendly approach should be made to any new family next door.

Some people argue that the misuse of the internet can adversely affect humans. However, I believe that access to so much information via the internet is beneficial to everyone although it can create some problems if it is used improperly. On the one hand, we are able to find answers to simple questions as well as complex queries within a second by browsing the internet. This definitely benefits every person around the world.  This technological advancement allows people to gain more information and knowledge on the happenings around the world in a fraction of a second.

For example, e-tuitions which enhance the academic performance of students are a product of the internet and are gaining popularity. The internet has also made online shopping, net banking, e-learning and social networking possible. These have made the life of people easier and more comfortable. On the other hand, the misuse of the internet can adversely harm the society as well as the individual.

Moreover, many terrorist groups have sites online to attract youngsters to work against their country. Cyber crime, another byproduct of the internet, is also on the rise.  Worse still, today’s children have access to the internet from an early age and often stumble upon content that is inappropriate for their age.

"Maintaining antique buildings in good conditions needs huge investments from governments. While some people believe that this money should be allocated for building new structures, I strongly believe that restoring old buildings is crucial to preserve the identity and history of a city.  Many cities around the world are famous for keeping old buildings well preserved. These constructions attract tourists interested in visiting buildings that make them feel that they are travelling back in time. For example, Venice is popular for its numerous old houses adjacent to the canals and its exceptionally beautiful antique churches from many centuries ago. The fact that the authorities decided to restore and maintain these structures makes these cities different from the rest. This, in turn, gives the people who live in those places a sense of identity and belonging.  When we preserve houses and buildings from the past, history is preserved as well. The younger generations are able to see and imagine how their ancestors lived. For instance in certain towns of Buenos Aires, houses and streets were built two stories above the sea level because the area used to get flooded often. Even though that does not happen anymore, the construction remains intact for children to learn how people used to live in that town. This way the history of a city is passed down through generations.  In conclusion, it is paramount to invest in restoring and maintaining old buildings in good conditions. They can provide information about the culture and particularities of a place. This will not only attract tourism but also preserve the history and beauty of a city.

"Abortion has been a controversial topic for centuries. Actually, even today, it is illegal even in some progressive societies. Some people insist that abortion should be legalized because a woman has the right to decide whether or not she wants to give birth to a baby. Others opine that abortion is immoral because no one has the right to take a life. In my opinion, women should have complete rights over their body and if they choose to terminate a pregnancy, they should be allowed to do so.  To begin with, each pregnancy takes its toll on a woman’s body. If she is not physically or mentally prepared for the baby, forcing her to carry it to full term will not be beneficial for either her or her baby. Also, in some cases, the pregnancy could be the result of rape or unwelcome marriage. In such cases too, the woman should be allowed to terminate it because forcing her to give birth to the baby will cause considerable emotional trauma to the mother and it could even hurt her relationship with her newborn.  Conversely, many people believe that only God can take a life and as such abortion is against His will. I do not quite agree with this view. While it is true that every life is precious, just giving birth to a baby is not sufficient. What is even more important is the being able to give a respectable and healthy upbringing to the child. Women who are not capable of doing this because of their physical, emotional, financial or other situations have a valid and ethical reason to terminate the pregnancy. They should not be forced to give birth to an unwanted child by making abortion illegal in the name of morality. In conclusion, abortion should be legal in all countries because making it illegal violates several fundamental rights of women. Being able to raise a baby with love and affection is a lot more important than giving birth and those who are not capable of doing so should never have to continue with the pregnancy simply because it does not help the life they bring into this world.",9,True,58.583526682134575,362
"People often compare the abilities of men and women and claim that women are not as competitive as men. I do not agree with this opinion. In my opinion, women are just as competitive as men and they have proved their mettle in almost all spheres.  At school, girl students routinely outperform boy students. If they were not competitive, they would not be able to achieve this. In various competitive examinations also girls perform as well as boys. If we compare a female doctor or a female scientist with their male counterparts we can see that in terms of skills they are on a par with each other.  Women have already proved that they can do any job. They now work in almost every field. They even work in aviation and defence. Traditionally, these jobs were thought to be suitable for only men. Even in the conservative Arabian countries, women are now allowed to join armed forces. This is a clear indication that women are capable of doing justice to whatever role they perform. Women are also showing exceptional managerial skills. For instance, many multinational companies are successfully managed by women. Women have also proved that they can make excellent leaders. In countries like the United Kingdom, Germany and Bangladesh women are at the top political positions. Some of the most loved and remembered politicians in history are actually women. Obviously, women are not inferior to men in any field.  Yet, a question may arise why there are not many women in research, politics or business. In my opinion, this is not because they are not competitive. Women have certain biological and psychological duties that only they can perform. Giving birth and raising children are just some of them. Because of these reasons, many women quit their jobs and that probably explains why we do not see a lot of female politicians or business tycoons. In order to establish themselves in such fields women have to dedicate their life to their career. Unlike men, this is not always possible for a woman because her other responsibilities as a daughter, wife and mother stand in the way of her career goals. However, just because women are quitting their jobs to start a family and raise kids, it does not mean that they are less competitive than men. In conclusion, after analysing all aspects of the given situation, it is not hard to see that women are just as capable and competent as men. If there are fewer female achievers than male achievers, that is because women tend to sacrifice their career for the sake of their family.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

In my opinion, through practice and determination, any child can become a successful artist or sportsperson.  Inborn talents certainly matter. People who are born with a natural aptitude for singing, drawing or sports can acquire proficiency in those fields with relatively less effort. If we consider the examples of great musicians, painters or sportsperson, it is not hard to see that the vast majority of them showed considerable talent in their respective fields in their childhood itself. Obviously, they were born with those skills. However, just because someone is born with a certain talent, it does not mean that they will achieve success in that field. In order to achieve success they have to hone their skills like everyone else. It is just that achieving success is relatively easier for them.  On the other hand, practice makes man perfect. Even if somebody is not born with exceptional artistic or athletic talents it is still possible for them gain excellence in the field of their choice through constant practice. That is because someone who practices a skill everybody certainly has an edge over someone who rarely practises that skill in spite of being born with a special talent for it. For example, a research conducted by Sports Authority of India, concluded that any child can develop outstanding skills in sports provided that they are trained well. In other words, practice is the secret to success.  To conclude, through consistent practice it is possible for anyone to achieve expertise in arts and sports. This, however, does not mean that inborn skills are irrelevant. They do matter but those born with special talents also need practice to gain proficiency.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Traffic congestion has become a global problem that jeopardizes human activities and affects the environment adversely. Some people argue that the best way to solve this issue is to provide free public transport. I believe that such a move will address the problem to a certain extent; however, it will not resolve it completely. In my opinion, a better solution is to build better and wider roads. Firstly, providing public transport at no cost will encourage more number of people to use it. According to a survey conducted by “The Hindu”, nearly 46% of commuters readily agreed to utilize such a facility, owing to the fact that they can save a lot, in terms of money and fuel. Obviously, a free transport network will have a large number of users. Nevertheless, there are some downsides to it. The foremost point of concern is that it will cost the government a great deal of money and thus burden the common man with heavy taxes. Taxes are not the only problem, though. Another point to consider is the peak hour traffic during which public transport is a very inconvenient option. Most offices provide free pick up and drop facilities for their employees to make their peak hour commute more comfortable. These people will certainly not want to use the public transport. What’s more, people living a life of luxury and comfort will want to travel by their own mode of transport at a time convenient to them. Thus it is evident that the idea of a no cost travel will not appeal to everyone. In conclusion, providing free transport in cities will ease traffic congestion to a great extent. However, it is not a foolproof solution. if the government is looking for a lasting solution, it has to build better roads.",8,True,76.052509584647,298
"We are in a celebrity obsessed world, and what famous persons especially those with ordinary backgrounds say or do always make news headlines. The factors contributing to this phenomenon will be discussed in this essay along with the reasons why I believe this is a curse rather than a blessing.  The obvious gap in the living standards between well-known persons and ordinary people results in this phenomenon. It is generally acknowledged that the vast majority of celebrities can monetize their accounts and accumulate massive wealth instantly, purchasing what their desire without taking costs into consideration. Conversely, the average people are confronted with various problems caused by not having enough money. For example, they find it difficult to buy a flat or afford the tuition fee of their children. Hence, ordinary people who struggle to afford even the basic necessities of life have so much interest in celebrities who seem to have everything so easy. I believe this leads to some undesirable results. To begin with, these celebrities are always in spotlights and reap a myriad of fans who show great admiration to their idols. Most of these famous persons are living extravagant lifestyles, wearing designer clothes and driving luxurious cars. Their admirers choose to support them by following their lifestyles, and purchase those pricy products, even if they cannot afford them. Consequently, these fans have to reduce the amount of money spent on other facets of their lives, such as health, workouts and further education lowering their life quality. In addition, exposure to the lives of well-known persons with ordinary backgrounds will inspire average people to obtain fame at any costs for the sake of achieving high-quality lives. In their desperation to gain fame, some of these people leak their porn clips online or make racist remarks, which not only achieves a bad name for them but also sets negative examples to others.   In conclusion, ordinary people’ s interest in celebrities can be attributed to the differences between their lives and those of famous one’ s, and such interest is a negative thing, since this may lower their life quality and make some of them embark on the wrong path.",8,True,115.44764795144158,360
"Approval of the medicines for human use is a tedious process which involves a series of tests often performed on animals. While some people support this idea because it makes drugs safer for human consumption, others believe that it is an unethical practice. Personally, I am in favour of the idea that medicines should be tested in all possible scenarios before being released to the public.Those against animal experimentation argue that animals have the same rights as human beings because they are the outcome of the same evolution process through which humans came into existence. Infecting them with viruses and exposing them to bacteria, to create a conducive environment to test a chemical substance may cause excruciating pain to these lab animals. Any failed test can mean that the subject either loses its precious life or suffers for the rest of its existence, and understandably, some people are against what they consider an immoral practice.Nonetheless, if a drug is released into the market without a thorough end-to-end testing, it could cause severe damage to anyone who may consume it. Every day a large number of animals are being mercilessly killed by humans for their mere flesh and skin. There isn’t a big difference between killing an animal for food and sacrificing its life for testing a chemical composition, because both actions are helping the human race to survive. What’s more, the life of one animal used to test a life-saving drug could help many people live. This is why a large number of people believe that testing drugs on animals is a matter of survival.To sum up, there are valid reasons why animal testing seems cruel and unacceptable to some, and crucial to others. In my opinion, even though animals subjected to testing may suffer, it is a necessary step to ensure the healing power of a drug.",8,True,71.8094742352636,308
"Film industry has grown significantly over the last few decades and some companies allocate a colossal budget to produce just one movie. Personally I do not believe that the quality of the movie depends on how much money was spent on it. Rather what matters are the storyline and the talent of the actors and other people associated with the movie. Producing a film is definitely a process which requires a lot of money. Costumes, cameras, make up and exotic locations are all components of a regular movie and for sure cost a fortune. However, producers overspend when producing a film and incur unnecessarily expenses to add special effects expecting that in this way they will enrich the film. Yet these are not the key factors that determine if the movie is good enough or not. Firstly, the storyline plays the most vital role in the success of a film. If the story is not strong enough to attract the audience, making a film on it is undoubtedly fruitless and will have devastating results. Secondly, choosing the actors who suit the role they are playing is also imperative. Many film stars have become instrumental in producing legendary movies because of their talent and their incredible ability to enact the characters in the most realistic way. For example, movies of hugely popular actors like Tom Cruise become successful regardless of their storyline or budget. To conclude, although film production needs a huge chunk of money, it is not the key factor in making the film successful as the story, the acting and the direction are equally if not more important.

"In ancient times, teachers were given the highest order and respect in the society. Hence there was considerable interest in becoming a teacher. However, things have changed in this modern world and fewer people want to pursue teaching as their career. There are multiple reasons for this.  Nowadays there are plenty of other higher paying jobs which can easily satisfy their needs. Also, many other jobs such as that of an engineer, scientist, doctor etc are considered to be more prestigious in the society. This essay will discuss why youngsters are reluctant to take up teaching as their profession. This essay will also suggest some ways to alter this mindset.  Although teaching is still considered as a passion by many, the majority of the youngsters avoid getting into this field and they have a valid reason for this. There is a huge disparity in the salaries of a teacher and a doctor or engineer. Other professionals are given more benefits such as life insurance, healthcare, free food etc. With better pay, they can easily manage their expenses but this is not the case with teachers – they are given hardly any benefit. Since this gap is easily visible to people, they tend to incline more towards other jobs. For instance, according to a survey conducted by the Human Resources Committee in India, teaching is amongst the lowest paid profession. However, this scenario can be easily avoided. If teenagers are given proper counseling then they might think better and take the correct decision. Parents play a major role here. They should encourage their children to pursue anything which interests them. Children should be taught since their childhood that no job is insignificant / trivial. It is the mindset of the people which needs to change. For instance in Canada, the government is running campaigns wherein it encourages the younger ones to consider this job.

"It is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.To begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.In addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.In contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly. The early signs of this have been seen in many countries that were forced to raise the retirement age, including my home country where men can now retire at the age of 67 instead of 65. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, these kinds of support may become completely unsustainable.In conclusion, the provision of state monetary support may undoubtedly lessen the concern of retirees to some extent. However, considering the issue of sustainability of this provision, it is better to opt for individual savings from the very beginning of working life, for the benefit of both individual and national development.",8,True,77.634375,377

"Nowadays, it is acknowledged that students from suburban areas find it tough to receive higher education. Whether it should be made easier for them to access university education becomes an ongoing concern, which incurs a highly-charged debate.Obviously, higher education opportunities bring about benefits to students in multiple ways. For example,  higher education becomes increasingly important to senior high school graduates, partly  it determines if they have the competitive edge in the job market, and partly because it is seen as a guarantee of a certain level of the mental ability, from the computer literacy that is required by the most employers to the capacities of acquiring new knowledge the soonest possible which is valued by  most .

But I perceive their desire to further their education should not be disrespected and the government should subsidise them to receive higher education.In conclusion, university education should be made fair to everyone, predicated only on their academic performance and mental abilities, rather than their financial capacities and the government should subsidise those students in need.",6,True,75.53232810315879,267
"In many countries now the workforce consists of more women than men. Yet, there are few women in managerial positions. Hence, some people argue that a certain number of senior level positions should be reserved for women. In my opinion, this is not a viable solution because it will benefit neither women nor the organizations hiring them. Reserving jobs on the basis of gender benefits none. It will ensure that women can easily climb up the corporate ladder because there are positions reserved for them. Unfortunately, this will discourage them from achieving higher education or working hard. Hence, instead of reserving seats for women, girls should be taught from an early age that they too can become a manager or a CEO if they wish because the opportunities are there regardless of their genders. Furthermore, imposing a quota will only encourage companies to find another way to outsmart the system. For example, a company can change the title of a position to just fill a vacancy. For these reasons, women are not benefited when jobs / positions are reserved for them at the workplace. On the other hand, it is important for the company to be able to employ the best available candidate for the positions. When there are no gender based quotas, it will ensure that the most talented people get to the top. Moreover, companies that hire the best people for the right positions tend to be more successful. This in turn will create more opportunities available within the company and then the company can hire more people including women to fill the additional available positions. Thus it is evident that reserving managerial positions for women is not the right solution to ensure gender equality at the workplace.  In conclusion, since forcing companies to hire more women just to follow the law can only cause more harm than good, I strongly believe that companies should be able to hire people based on their qualifications, and not gender.

"It is advocated by some people that in the planning of any building, utility & functionality should be given prime importance rather than its external face. In my opinion, while the purpose for which the building is built scores more points, both the factors play a crucial role. Talking about appearances, while first impressions may not be the vital criterion for choosing a service, they definitely cannot be ignored. The aesthetic appeal of magnificent structures constructed in many countries not only adds value to the assets, but it is also a delight for the tourists and many International Geographic channels. Dubai, for instance is well known for its majestic buildings with awe striking features like Burj Khalifa which is visited by travelers and has been featured on various television programmes. However, while laying out a plan for any structure there are several factors which need to be considered. Firstly, the purpose for which the building is being constructed is the sole deciding factor for the rest of the other things. For example, an old age home will need to be safer and convenient for the geriatric patients. Therefore, there would be many slopes and railings all over for wheelchairs and comfortable navigation. On the other hand, the requirement for a shopping mall may be entirely different and it should be more glamorous to capture the attention of public. Secondly, the budget required to construct the same would also determine if the building can be made fancier or if it should remain simple while serving the main use. Last but not least is the location and the kind of people around. For instance, in a small town in India, perhaps an outward look of any building may be the last concern of most people.  To summarize, I believe that while the functionality should be at the core of any structure, the external beauty cannot be completely ignored.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Band 9 essay sample Physical activity plays an important role in the physical and psychological development of children during the initial years of their life. However, urbanization and modernization have replaced outdoor games with indoor games and thus increased the number of couch potatoes among the current generation. In my view this is a negative development that affects the physical and mental development of children. Firstly, urbanization eliminated public playgrounds from cities and towns. Thanks to the development of all those housing complexes and shopping centres the cities have become more congested than ever leaving no room for little ones to enjoy outdoor games like cricket or football. Since playing such sports in narrow streets cause disturbance to apartment dwellers parents are forced to keep their children indoors. The security of children has also become a cause for concern. Parents are becoming wary of letting their children play outside. So, to keep them engaged indoors they equip their children with video games, computers and smart phones. As a result, children are getting detached from the benefits of playing outside. This, unfortunately, affects their physical and intellectual development. Sitting in front of a computer or gaming console for long hours can affect the eyesight of children and make them obese. Studies have shown that physical activity helps the development of cognitive abilities like decision-making and problem-solving. Sports and games also teach children crucial life skills such as team spirit and the ability to take success and failure alike. When children do not engage in sports, they are losing an opportunity to master these life lessons. To conclude, video games might keep children engaged for hours on end, but they do not help the overall development of children. So I strongly believe that spending too much time on playing computer games can be very harmful for the upcoming generation.    ",9,True,99.76707530647985,306

"In current society, the life expectancy in western countries has increased significantly. Also, fewer babies are being born, causing the relative percentage of elderly people to increase. These people have to be taken care of, causing the question to rise whether this number of elderly people can be cared for.When people grow older, they can also develop more health issues, resulting in more visits to doctors and hospitals, and an increased usage of pharmaceuticals. Due to the current large numbers of elderly people, the pressure put onto health care systems is increasing. In many western countries, the state provides most of the health care system. Therefore with increasing numbers of old people, higher percentages of state funding have to be allocated to health care and this could cause shortfalls in other areas, for example education. This change in the distribution of money can therefore impact society negatively.Society should be able to handle these changes. Governments will have been able to predict the changing demographic situations in their countries and plan accordingly. This might indeed lead to other sectors in society having money taken away from them, but caring for the elderly is one of the key responsibilities of today’s governments. For the future, it might be necessary to ensure that an extra insurance charge is levied on people’s salaries in order that any future financial shortfall is met.

"Rich people earn more than enough to lead a comfortable life so that they can spend their disposable income on anything they like. For instance, they can use their excess wealth for the well-being of other people. Take a look around and you will see that the biggest philanthropists are all rich people. Today multi-billionaires in the US and other countries do more philanthropy than the governments of the world. In other words, being rich helps in helping others. Hence, I agree with the given argument to a certain extent. Poor people, on the other hand, have to struggle hard to meet their own needs. When they don’t have enough money to meet their own needs they cannot donate money to help others. On the flip side, charity or philanthropy isn’t all about donating money. It also involves donating time and effort. Both rich and poor people can make a difference to the society. You don’t necessarily have to donate money to help people. If you can spare at least an hour a day you can help people in very many ways. If you are educated and have a few hours to spare a week, you can spend that time in teaching underprivileged kids. Those few hours will make a huge difference to their lives. And for doing that all that you need is a strong desire to help other people.  What this means is that although money plays a significant role in helping people it is not the only thing that matters. Charitable institutions also require people who can donate their time and goodwill. In other words, not being rich is no reason to stay out of philanthropy.  Looking at both sides of the argument, it doesn’t take a lot of effort to see that richness is not the only factor that determines a person’s ability to help others. It is important, but even if you are not rich you can help people in several other ways.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"It argued by some individuals that increasing the price of fuel for automobiles is an effective method to resolve environmental issues. I strongly agree with this statement and believe that the rise in the fuel rates will discourage people from using personal vehicles frequently. In addition to this people will also be more inclined to using electric cars which will result in reduced levels of air and sound pollution. To begin with, increasing the price of fuel will force people to limit the usage of personal cars. This will result in reduced amount of carbon dioxide emissions into the earth’s atmosphere which in turn will help in lowering pollution levels. For instance, a person who uses a vehicle everyday for commuting to work will be willing to access public transportation in order to deal with increased fuel rates instead of driving his/her own car. Hence, hike in fuel prices can aid in resolving environmental issues by making it difficult for the public to use personal vehicles on a daily basis. Another reason why increasing fuel charges is beneficial for the environment is that the public will be more inclined to buying electric cars rather than fossil fuel cars. Advancements in technology have helped in developing safe and budget friendly electric cars that are affordable for the general public. For example, Ellon Musk, CEO of Tesla motors has launched their first low price model which fully operates by using electricity resulting in zero gas emissions. Therefore, people would be encouraged to use electric cars as the costs involved in charging them are significantly lower than the cost of fuel. In conclusion, I believe that though people know the seriousness of global warming and other environmental issues we are facing today they still fail to act. Thus, raising the fuel prices will be a great means to combat environmental issues as it will not only be difficult for individuals to afford usage of personal vehicles but it also encourages them to use electric cars which are cheaper.

"Some people support the rule 18 years as minimum age to start riding car; however other feel that this age limit should be increased to 25. This essay will discuss both the views and give a reasonable conclusion. Firstly, people who argue that 18 is the perfect age to start driving a car is because they feel that most teenagers become biologicallymature at this age. Most countries have concluded through several scientific studiesthat juveniles can learn driving and overcome their road fear at early age like 18. Moreover, during this mature age they start going to college and need to have enough facilities like own transport to live an independent life. Hence, most countries allow to start driving at 18 years. However, some people believe that minimum age limit to issue driving license should be increased to 25 years because they see driving as a serious affair. Most youngsters get carried away by passion to ride at high speed and lead to serious road accidents. For instance, in a country like India where roads are so shabby and easy to cause vehicle collision, speeding is a common factor for serious fatalities. Therefore, driving should be permitted at age of 25 to ensure safety of citizens. In conclusion, I believe from the above discussed points that governments should continue to issue driving license at age of 18 because it is the perfect age to learn driving and teenagers need to have their own transport to enjoy life. However, their intention to drive furiously could be controlled by enforcing strict traffic laws and legislation in place.",7,True,79.6520195295162,256
"Note that all band score estimates are approximate. Raising children is considered a cumbersome task which requires skills and knowledge of all stages of physical development. I completely agree to the belief that parents should acquire the skills through various parenting courses provided in the community. Becoming a parent itself naturally enhances the protective instincts of a person and one tends to take great detail of all the aspects of the newly acquired responsibilities. To help understand these responsibilities better, there are published materials such as booklets in addition with the training offered by the hospitals for a new parent. For instance, a new mother was successful in alleviating the colic problem of her infant using the massage techniques shown in the new born massage techniques course. Lack of such skills might lead to frequent visits to the hospital or clinics along with the physical and mental trauma of both parties. Furthermore, many educational institutions and community centers offer numerous seminars and courses relevant to the respective age group of the child. They might be simple courses ranging from ways to handle bullying at school to behavioral issues. Parents can attend these classes and be more competent to handle sudden situations.They can also advise the child accordingly which might come in handy at a later stage. To exemplify this, a child received accolades for showing presence of mind and turning down a lift offered by a stranger which might have been a potential kidnapping case.

However, the content and the type of music can act as barriers. I agree with the argument that music which is pleasant and widely acceptable can be used for promoting harmony. Music is one of the forms of art which transcends boundaries of nations and attracts audience all around the world. It is not uncommon to see music lovers come together / unite enthusiastically despite belonging to different age groups, gender, caste or creed. It has been noted time and again that people belonging to varying backgrounds have joined hands for several social and charitable causes by virtue of their common liking for music. However, there are certain factors such as genre and lyrics which can affect this. For example, a person with interest in classical music might not prefer to attend a western music concert. If someone is not proficient in English, one might not prefer spending time with people who discuss English music. Music with profane and objectionable content directed towards one particular sect of people might not be well received and may even adversely cause communal disharmony Hence, I believe that music which is soothing, commonly understood and accepted can be used to promote bonding between the people of different cultures and ages. Also, it is essential to monitor the content of the music to assess the suitability as per the social and cultural norms for better acceptance.

"Some people argue that education should be accessible to everyone free of cost regardless of their financial status / background. I totally agree with this argument. Nowadays, educational qualifications are the primary requirements for any high paid jobs since most companies like to hire individuals with college degrees. Firstly, making education available to all at no cost means that every individual in the society has an equal opportunity to get a professional job. Many people often complain that they could not get receive university education because it was expensive. For instance, Times reported that Norwegians have more patents to their names than people of any other country ever since Norway made education free for all in 1980. Education is important in everyone’s life because it is essential to meet basic needs such as food and shelter. If a person failed to graduate then this individual would find it harder to find a satisfying job. This might force him to look for alternative options to make easy money rather than work hard and he could end up in jail. Moreover, if a society is educated then it will prosper and bring more happiness and joy to the country. Consequently, the country’s productivity and efficiency will increase because of its highly educated workforce. For example, a Harvard study concluded that the productivity of countries like China and India increased by over 200 percent during the last 20 years because of an increase in literary rate arising from free education.

"Nowadays both the parents work due to financial reasons and because of their busy schedules, their children suffer. It is believed by some people that for children’s better upbringing and proper care, either mother or father should be paid to stay at home by the government. There are certainly some benefits to this practice; however, there are several disadvantages too. To begin with, one of the obvious benefits of keeping one parent at home is that it ensures better care of the child. Needless to say, parents understand the needs of their children better than others because they share a stronger emotional bond with them. That is why if they stay with them, they will provide the best care and attention to their children. Money is the main reason that encourages both parents to work. If the government provides monetary assistance to one of them, they can stay at home without having to worry about meeting the expenses of raising a baby.  On the contrary, there are some drawbacks to having such policies as it will put extra burden on the government.  We all are aware that the government has many areas to work on such as education, poverty, employment and all of these require more funds. In order to pay money to parents, it has to reduce its spending in other areas and that might have even more adverse effects on a country’s economy. Also the parent who decides to stay home to care for the child may find it difficult to secure a good job once they decide to return to the job market.  To conclude, it is indeed true that a care provider cannot provide the same care as a parent. If the government offers financial assistance to one of the parents for staying at home, it will definitely benefit the child. However, it will put strain on the public exchequer.

"The impact of economic development on the society is always debated nowadays. While some people believe that it is harming the environment, there are also people who believe that it is helping the developing countries to eradicate poverty. In my opinion, the only way to stop poverty is to develop the economy by creating jobs and growing various sectors. Firstly, in order to end poverty, the governments of those third world nations need to create more jobs by building plants to produce goods for exports. These factories will create demand for labour, and eventually these workers will have a source of income. Therefore, they can build up their wealth and improve their lifestyles. Furthermore, countries that have limited natural resources need to grow their economy in different sectors to stay away from poverty. Singapore is a classic example. They spent many years to develop their financial sectors in order to stay competitive, and now they have become one of the richest nations in Asia. However, it is undeniable that building up the economy of a country will affect the environment. Some people would argue that this will accelerate the global warming because development often involves deforestation. Trees are cut down to build houses. As a result, carbon dioxide will increase significantly and this will potentially worsen the global warming issue. However, halting economic development is not the solution. Rather we should find ways to grow the economy without harming the environment. For example, new age technologies like solar energy and electric cars do not cause much harm to the environment. Investing in such technologies is the solution we need today. In conclusion, although some environmental damage will inevitably occur, people can enjoy better life when jobs are created. If the country says no to economic development for the sake of environment, they will not be able to survive for long. Therefore, on balance, I believe that economic advancement is the only way for the country to grow and prosper and as such it should not be halted.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some scientists argue that there is life on other planets and it is good to send messages to contact them while other scientists believe that these kinds of activities will be a threat to human existence on earth. In my opinion, trying to interact with life forms on other planets may have negative impacts on human life and it is better to avoid it. Some scientists believe that contacting life forms on other planets is beneficial. If human beings can contact them, their resources can be utilized for the betterment of human life. For example, human population is increasing and natural resources are depleting. If we get alternative energy sources from them, it will be a great help for the human population on earth. If the interaction with the life on other celestial bodies has a positive impact on human beings, it will be good but there is no guarantee for this. This kind of positive relationship is just an expectation. If extra terrestrial beings are superior to us, they are more likely to have destructive effect on us. Superior species always dominate inferior species just like human beings dominate other forms of life on earth. Many other living beings on earth are under threat of extinction as human beings are superior to them. Similarly, extra terrestrial beings may wipe out human beings from the earth. Moreover, great scientists such as Stephen Hawking have already given us warning against interaction with life forms on other planets. Human beings can live happily on this planet if they utilize natural resources wisely instead of exploiting them. There is no need to search for resources from other planet when there is no guarantee that they can help human species. In conclusion, in my opinion, relationship with the life on other planets may have negative effects on the life on earth. It is better to use the resources on earth wisely and live here happily instead of trying to colonize other planets.",8,True,55.49100563382507,328
"People are well aware of the significance of the environment. However, they are least concerned about protecting it. There are several reasons for this attitude. This essay will look into the causes and also discuss certain measures to encourage citizens to conserve the nature.  To start with, one of the biggest problems is that people presume that it is the sole responsibility of the government to protect the environment. For instance, when they dump waste in a public place such as the traffic highways or the beach, they expect the cleaning staff to keep the surrounding areas neat and tidy. So, people assume that protecting mother nature is not their duty. Another cause is the belief that an individual alone cannot tackle the global environmental crisis. They believe that large organizations alone can conserve nature. Hence, most people are unconcerned.  There are several strategies to motivate people to preserve the earth. Firstly, the governing body should create awareness among the public about the deteriorating status of the nature and the threats posed by it to humans. To exemplify, they can use various mass medias like the tv and internet for publicising the urgent need to protect the environment. Secondly, large groups such as private organizations or school children engaging in such conservation activities can motivate others to do the same. Moreover, rewarding them can encourage  people to preserve the environment To sum up, despite knowing the importance of the nature, the public is least bothered to protect it. This is mainly due to the poor mentality of the individuals. It can be tackled by the help of the government and other private associations.",8,True,74.64737760780791,273
"On the one hand, some people believe that the state should spend money to motivate bicycle use as it is healthy and environment friendly. When people are encouraged to use bicycles as the primary mode of transport pollution and consumption of fossil fuels will come down. To illustrate this, as the majority of people are using bicycles in Melbourne, the amount of particulate matter in air is very low according to a recent survey by the state. Furthermore, it is observed that when more people start using the bicycle the society becomes healthier. As cycling is a good physical activity, people who regularly use bicycle to commute stay healthy and this will motivate others to adopt this practice.  On the other hand, others contend that improving public transport networks through enhanced funding by the state will save time and reduce traffic congestion in cities. An efficient and affordable transport system is considered a boon to office goers and ordinary people as it saves much time which is very vital in their busy work schedule. So it is the responsibility of the state to allocate more funds for building an efficient public transport system. A clear example of this is the metro train service in Chennai which has efficiently reduced the travel time by half for people travelling on it. Moreover, the provision of a good transport system in the cities helps to control the traffic congestion which is considered to be a mounting issue in most cities due to urbanisation and population outburst. To sum up, after analysing the situation, it is not hard to see that both approaches have their merits. In my opinion, the government should encourage cycling and at the same time it should invest more in public transport systems. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"How can this problem be solved ? Nowadays, overpopulation is increasingly becoming problematic. Cities around the world are becoming very crowded and this is a serious problem. This essay will discuss the reasons why this is happening and put forward some solutions for this issue. To begin with, there are two main causes of overcrowding in cities. Firstly, the concentration of public services such as hospitals and schools in cities. It is easier for people in cities to have access to such services than those in rural areas. For instance, approximately 90% of public services in Sudan are in cities. This clearly shows that people migrate to cities looking for these services. Another reason of overcrowding in cities is their vibrant and active lifestyle which attracts people from rural areas. Generally speaking, the easy access to public services and the fast pace of life in cities are the main reasons of overpopulation in cities. On the other hand, the overcrowding in urban areas around the world can be addressed in two ways. First of all, governments must provide public services to people in the countries. The sick people instead of travelling to cities looking for treatment will be able to have access to doctors in their counties. Furthermore, governments must build new cities to decrease the size of population in overcrowded cities and metropolitan areas. For example, the Japanese government has successfully reduced the size of population in its big and crowded cities by 20% by building new cities. This clearly prove the effectiveness of such a measure in reducing the number of people in overcrowded cities across the globe. To sum up, this essay discussed the reasons why cities are becoming overcrowded which in brief because of the concentration of public services in cities and the vibrancy of lifestyle in them. In addition, this essay offered two solutions for such a problem and these are providing public services in rural areas and constructing new urban cities.",7,True,50.01420644500213,324
"Criminal tendencies have nothing to do with age. It is observed that the number of juveniles committing serious crimes is on the rise. Some people opine that teenagers committing heinous crimes should receive the same punishment as adults. I fully agree with this view. When teen offenders are treated like adults and given the same punishment, it will be a lesson for other teens contemplating crime.  First of all, the age of the offender is irrelevant in the case of grave crimes like murder or rape. Many teenage criminals these days are not afraid of the consequences of their act since most states currently protect them under the Child Protection Law and give them only light punishments. For example they are asked to do community service for 6 months or put in rehabilitation centres for just about a year for misdeeds likes robbery. Juveniles committing major offences are also treated rather leniently. Unfortunately, this sends the wrong message and encourages more teens to commit crime. Therefore it is paramount to give severe punishments to teen offenders so that neither they nor their peers will want to commit crimes again.  Secondly, if a child is old enough to commit a heinous crime, he should definitely be considered old enough to be punished as well. This is vital to reduce the number of repeat crimes committed by these individuals. According to a survey by the Harvard University, countries that award severe punishments for all criminals regardless of their age had a significantly lower juvenile crime rate than the countries that protect children from receiving adult punishments. This is the reason why it is crucial to treat teen offenders just like adults. In conclusion, the problem of growing juvenile crime can only be tackled by awarding them punishments in accordance with the gravity of the offence that they committed.

"Some people put forth the argument that film is a less valuable art form than literature and painting. Nevertheless, I completely disagree with this argument and I will elaborate on my view in this essay. Nobody would deny that books and drawings have a much longer history than movies. Old art forms art forms are rooted in the ancient world and bring fruitful data to modern historians and anthropologists to conduct research on the customs and culture of our ancestors. However, an object’s historical value is not merely counted by the number of years it has been in existence, but also by the intrinsic value it possesses. Despite the fact that a film has a comparatively short history, it contains irreplaceable elements for us to witness how the modern technology evolves. For instance, from no sound in the olden days to surround sound effect in the modern world, movies have showcased the rapid advancement of technology over the past several decades.  From the perspective of entertainment / as far as entertainment is concerned, proponents of literature and paintings argue that they have higher value than films because the two art forms are manifestations of elegance and refined grace. Yet I believe that beauty is subjective and it depends on the tastes of individuals. While some people have a particular fondness for literature and painting due to their classic nature, others’ passion lies in watching movies which are deeply connected with the modern art form. Since modern people often follow the fashion trends of celebrities they adore and the high-end gadgets they use, going to the theatre is a highly rated entertainment and art form among people nowadays.  To conclude, I believe that films / movies have the same artistic value as literature and painting. One cannot gauge the artistic value of films merely from the number of years of history they have or some kind of subjective taste preference.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is often argued that high remuneration is more significant than contentment at workplace. In my opinion, I completely agree with this statement as earning high wage greatly benefits an individual to stay blissful and motivated. Firstly, having a hefty pay scale helps a person to stay exultant. This is because when an individual receives a fat paycheck he or she can afford an exquisite lifestyle which everyone desires. Moreover, they can purchase lavish home and luxurious cars to provide themselves and their children a comfortable living. Conversely, when an individual does not have high remuneration they often feel dissatisfied and distressed which leads to diseases such as depression and heart ailments. For example, in a recent survey it was reported that 55% of individuals are afflicted with constant stress because they are not satisfied with their pay scale. Another important reason is that high income keeps an individual motivated at work. This is because when a firm pays high salaries to their employees they feel contented and passionate about their job. In other words, to propitiate the benefits that company provided to an employee, the staff works with more efficacy and tenacity. As a result, it propels the growth of both the individual and the company. For example, in 2018 in China the yearly performance of a firm grew exponentially after they had announced an increase in salaries of its employees. In conclusion, I consider that having a bigger income boosts happiness and keeps an individual encouraged to work which ultimately induces fulfillment in their lives.

"Some people say that increasing the number of sports facilities will greatly enhance public health. However, others oppose this view and believe that it will only help to some extent and other more effective measures are required to ensure public health. I strongly support the latter view. There are people who opine that increasing the number of sports facilities will contribute to the betterment of public health. By this initiative, the government can motivate people to participate in various sports and become physically active and mentally fit. For example, sports will help them to burn out their excess calories and and also provide an opportunity to interact with others, which in turn, enhance their psycho-social well-being. Having said that, the majority of the people believe that sports facilities alone cannot ensure the health of people. This is because the public comprises of people of different age-groups right from infants to seniors and it is not possible to ensure the participation of all of them in sports. On the other hand, facilities like vaccination campaigns, free medical check-up, distribution of health supplements and health educational classes at public places will deliver better results. For instance, medical students conduct free health camps at public places on occasions like ‘World Diabetes Day’. Another case in point is the midday meal programme launched by the government of India in 1995. It provides free lunches to students in all government schools with the aim of improving their nutritional status. This scheme has not only encouraged parents to send their child to school but also resulted in enhancement of their health status. Therefore, it is evident that other measures contribute more to public health than sports facilities. To conclude, though sports facilities enhance public heath to some extent, other measures such as creating health awareness and offering free or subsidised healthcare are much more effective.",8,True,77.42198581560284,308
"There is no denying the fact that societies are becoming more and more alike. People all over the world now eat the same kind of food, watch the same TV shows and wear the same kind of clothes. Part of the reason behind this phenomenon is the growth of multinational companies. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this trend? Let’s first look at the positive sides. While globalization can be blamed for making people wear the same kind of clothes and eat the same kind of food, it is also responsible for creating more job opportunities and wealth. It has considerably reduced poverty in the undeveloped world. Globalization has also led to better understanding among countries. When people from across the world get to know each other, it is good for global harmony.  Does this mean that cultural identities are being lost? Well, not really. You cannot understand the culture of a society by looking at the way its people look or dress. The foundation of any culture is its value system which is passed from one generation to the next. In my opinion it is these values that distinguish an Indian from an American. They might wear the same kind of clothes or even speak the same language, but their value systems are going to be different in many aspects. For example, family ties are extremely important for an Indian. Even after sons and daughters get married it is quite common for them to continue to stay with their parents. Indians are also taught to obey and respect their parents. Although I am not all that familiar with the American culture, I think there the emphasis is on self-reliance. In my opinion, these traits and beliefs are the cultural identity of a person and a society. It is unaffected by the way they look or talk. To summarize, I do not think that globalization will lead to the total loss of cultural identity.

"Sample EssayThese days, people’s perspectives on the value of clothing are changing, and individuals tend to wear similar clothing compared to people in the past who opted for their traditional clothing. I believe this tendency exerts a positive influence on the society.It is certainly true that there are some drawbacks to this tendency because it may lead to a loss of global diversity. It can be argued those who wear ordinary clothes such as T-shirts and jeans cannot feel a connection to their roots, and they are likely to neglect their culture and the contribution of their ancestors. Therefore, these people may not take pride in their region, and they might migrate to an urban location rather than contribute to the development of their community. Consequently, many ethnic minorities could suffer from  depopulation and eventually disappear.However, I believe that there are more positives than negatives in people opting for similar clothes. The first explanation is that individuals can feel a sense of unity with people all over the world even though they have different religions and ways of life. This  would motivate people in the world to support one another, instead of thinking that different parts of the world should deal with their own problems when natural disasters and other terrible problems occur in different nations. Furthermore, this tendency is economically profitable. Generally speaking, as ordinary clothes are automatically manufactured, they can be produced faster and more affordably than traditional clothing such as Japanese Kimono, which is hand-crafted.In conclusion, although people today tend to wear similar clothes instead of traditional ones and this trend  cause several problems, I believe that the society as a whole can reap more benefits of this tendency.",8,True,94.9616368286445,282
"Some people believe that studying arts should be made compulsory in schools because it would improve the overall performance of the students and being multi-skilled, they can easily learn new things. However, I do not agree with this view and I will defend my stand in the following paragraphs.  One of the most important aspects of art subjects is that they could improve the social skills of the pupils. This is because the disciplines like music and theatre would help them to overcome their hesitation and boost their confidence to face people / face an audience. For example, when a child sings a song in front of a huge audience, use they when the sex is unknown or insignificant become more confident than before. However / by contrast it would be overwhelming to even stand on the stage for those who have never been in such a situation. Besides this, disciplines such as drawing and painting would enhance their imagination and creativity.  Nevertheless, arts should not be obligatory in academia as compulsion would lead to pressure and thus affect the students’ performance. For instance, technical studies require a lot of concentration and hard work, and if those students are forced to attend music or dance classes, this would overburden them and reduce their concentration in the core studies. Hence, arts could be made optional, so that those who are interested would take it by their own wish and reap its benefits. This would not only reduce their stress but also prepare them for the promising future. In conclusion, although art studies would enhance social skills and enhance creative thinking in pupils, I believe that it should not be made a compulsory part of their curriculum as forcing is naturally averse to humans, and it would do more harm than good.",8,True,92.60707836764175,298
"Solar energy has become an increasingly popular energy source in many different places around the world. There are several good reasons for using solar energy as a primary energy source, but as it is with any source of energy it has its pros and cons. Firstly, solar energy is gaining popularity because in many countries it can be a viable energy source that has the potential to reduce the strain on the environment by minimising the use of fuels / energy sources that release a higher amount of greenhouse gases. Secondly, it is in trend with today’s society where we have an increased focus on local production. In sun-rich areas solar panels could potentially be placed directly on buildings, making it possible to make houses and buildings self-sustainable by producing their own energy. Despite the clear advantages of reducing environmental strain and satisfying the need for the local production of energy, there are some disadvantages to using solar energy. A normal household’s energy requirement is ever increasing, and as of now solar energy does not seem to be efficient enough to cover it. It is particularly hard during the winter season when the sun is visible for only a few hours. Another argument against the use of solar energy is that covering rooftops with solar panels ruins their aesthetic appeal. Solar energy has yet another downside. It is not exactly cheap. The initial cost of installation can be pretty high and this makes it unaffordable to many families.  In summary, solar energy has the potential to be a sustainable energy source in certain parts of the world, but the technology needs to be developed further for it to be efficient enough to cover the energy requirement of a modern household, and to be a viable solution in areas with less sun. There are clear advantages in terms of reducing release of green house gases, and hopefully it will be possible to sustain modern households on clean energy sources such as solar energy in the future.

"There is no denying the fact that school children are under tremendous pressure to perform well in academics. It is no secret that the students who score high grades in academics are more likely to have a successful career in the future compared to their counterparts, who score average or below-average. Many schools offer these days both academic and non- academic subjects in their curriculum to ensure the holistic growth of their students’ minds. There are many arguments about whether schools should adopt an all-inclusive approach or drop out vocational subjects that add no value to the intellect of a child’s mind. In my opinion, non academic subjects are immensely beneficial to the pupils because they enable them to master a versatile set of stills. To begin with, there are many reasons to include vocational subjects in the curriculum. Firstly, by learning art and craft students can overcome the performance pressure imposed on them by parents and teachers. These activities like dance, drama, singing, cookery or physical education cause no unnecessary strain on learning minds. In fact, they provide relaxation and help these brainers to concentrate better on academic subjects. Also, learning these subjects is indispensable for the overall development of children.  Additionally, pupils with innate artistic or other talents can hone them when they get to practice those talents at school and become eminent performers of tomorrow. For example, a renowned cricketer was discovered by his sports teacher while he was playing in the school playground. Thanks to his teacher’s encouragement, he later pursed cricket and became unbeatable at the cricket ground. Thus it is evident that learning non-academic subjects at school will help not only the students but also the society.  To conclude, it is utterly ridiculous to eliminate non-academic subjects from the syllabus. In my opinion, schools should encourage to pursue a career in a field of their choice.

"Art is a crucial part of cultural heritage. Therefore, across the globe art forms an important element of cultures. However, nowadays, not many people are interested in arts. Actually, the majority of people lean towards subjects like science, technology and business. The main reason behind this is the money earned after learning these subjects as they offer better job prospects. However, this situation can be tackled if authorities take a few measures in association with the general public. People are losing interest in arts as they do not consider it as a practical subject. In other words, learning art may not help them secure a good job in a multinational company. Many artists struggle to earn their livelihood as compared to those employed in sectors of business and technology. Focusing on subjects other than art is considered as a gateway to success. To illustrate, a recent survey conducted by the Times Magazine has showed that many science graduates get better job offers than art graduates.  However, art is the backbone of our culture. Lack of interest in art will eventually lead to the death of rich cultural heritages across the world. The government can help to revive interest of young generations in art. The authorities should allocate budget for developing art field by constructing art schools and maintaining art galleries. Organising cultural events will generate jobs for many and will attract many tourists. Increase in the number of tourists will help generate more revenue. The better financial prospects will act as a boost for people to pursue art as a passion and a career option.

Some parents send their children to pre-school at a very young age while others wait for their children to reach the age they think is right to get admission in primary school. This approach has beneficial and adverse impacts on / outcomes for children. The essay will analyze both sides of the argument.  Elementary education has always proved to be beneficial for children. It provides the foundation on which the middle and high school curriculum expands. Thus, it helps the children shape their mind and gives them apparent concept of the basics of education. Firstly, it helps the children to learn skills at an early age. For instance, they start learning addition and subtraction early which help them in later age. Secondly, being around with kids from an early age motivates the children to socially interact with the community. Sending them to schools at an early age helps the children acquire wider general knowledge. As a result, children can form attitudes and opinions about things. On the other hand, there are some downsides to sending kids to pre-school. It can affect the bonding between parents and kids. For instance, the child will be denied the love and affection which is of utmost importance to them. Moreover, not all children have the power to grasp things so early and this inability could lead the child to succumb to fear and could also make him feel inferior or defeated by his fellow mates.

In their opinion, these innovations have helped the mankind. I agree with the latter view. This essay will discuss how the advantages in medical sciences and enhanced communication have helped the humans. The first and foremost advantage is the innovation of medicine. Vaccinations have helped not only the humans, but also the animals. Now people do not die of any preventable disease. Gone are the days when people died from a simple fever or epidemic like plague.

People need to be social and communicate with each other. Mobile communication and internet have helped to take it to the next level and set new benchmarks for communications. People can use text, audio or video to socialise. Children can talk to parents while they are travelling. People can find and talk to their friends irrespective of time and location.

"One of the most pressing issues in every country is the traffic problem. In order to solve this problem, some people suggest that the government should impose heavy tax on private car owners and use that money to improve public transport. In my opinion, this option has advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, heavy tax on private vehicles will discourage most people from buying cars. This will also help in reducing pollution to a great extent, as there will be less emission of harmful gases. Also, the tax money collected from this measure can be used to improve public transport. For example, the government can use it to build better roads and well equipped bus stations and railway stations. This will also boost infrastructural development in the country. However, any such decision to increase tax on private vehicles will put people at a disadvantage. Not everybody resides in areas where they have easy access to public transport. For instance, in most countries farmers own land far from the city. They need their own vehicle to get to the nearest bus station or train station. Another issue is that if people stop buying cars to avoid taxes it will have an adverse impact on car manufacturers. This will lead to an acute drop in sales and profit and employees will not be paid appropriately. Eventually, this will cause unemployment and hamper the economic growth of the country in the long run. In conclusion, the decision to impose tax on private vehicles has merits and demerits. It might reduce pollution but at the same time it will cause a great deal of inconvenience to people.

This is because the fixed monthly wage that someone gets when employed by a company is more reliable. However, there are many ways to inspire people to start their own ventures. The main reason that encourages people to seek employment rather than launch their own business is the guaranteed monthly income they get when they are employed by an organization. In other words, when employees work for a company they are assured of hourly rates and annual leave. However, this might not be the case for a self-employed person because the income earned from the business might be variable as many businesses experience loss and profits from time to time according to the market conditions. Another reason is that a business requires a vast amount of time and knowledge to be successful in the industry but, nowadays, many people are not willing to put in that level commitment. Despite this, there are many measures that can be taken to motivate the businessmen and businesswomen. Firstly, the governments can implement loan schemes that allow people to borrow money at low interests as many of them suffer from financial difficulties when they start out. Secondly, many local businesses face failure because of their inability to compete with international giants. Hence, to prevent this, the government should enforce rules and regulations that prevent large conglomerates from flooding the market with cheap goods.  In conclusion, although working for a company is preferred by many people entrepreneurship should be promoted because it promotes large scale economic growth in the country. The governments can achieve this by providing financial or other incentives to people who want to start up. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Invented less than a hundred years ago, computers are an indispensable part of the human life today and are used everywhere, even inside the classrooms. With the increasing popularity of the computers in the education, many people ponder if they will eventually replace the teachers in the classroom. In my opinion, this is very unlikely as teachers play a pivotal role in our lives and cannot be replaced. Firstly, computers are man-made machines which can store a huge amount of knowledge. Despite this, they are not programmed to think creatively and cannot manage students from different cultural backgrounds. Teaching in a classroom requires individual attention and creativity as children have different caliber and pace at which they learn and absorb things. For instance, a child suffering from dyslexia will require special attention and care while studying and only a teacher can provide this. Secondly, students can relate to and understand the situation better when a personal touch or examples are involved. Teachers fulfill this requirement by supporting the theoretical studies with the relevant examples about a scenario. In addition, teachers organize different class-room activities such as group discussions and debates to keep students engaged and make learning a fun and frolic experience. Moreover, a teacher can notice even a slight change in a student’s attitude and behaviour and rectify it with proper guidance. Without this kind of interaction and understanding, learning and teaching will be ineffective. In conclusion, even though computers are a part of our daily routines teachers play an important role in shaping the lives of an individual by enlightening their paths and making them a better citizen and thus, the role played by teachers in education can’t be overlooked.

"It is true that the number of obese children is increasing in the modern society. As a result, those children are more likely to deal with health and financial issues in their adulthood. I opine that this phenomenon is coupled with the advancement of technology.  First, the advanced technology enables us to produce a variety of foods. People have become busier than ever in the modernized society and they tend to spend less time preparing their own food with natural ingredients. The easy availability of numerous prep meals or processed foods, which are produced based on the novel technology in this field, bolstered this trend. Unfortunately, those foods contain insufficient nutrition and surplus of calories. They have tremendous effects on people’s weight and health, especially children’s. They are impressionable beings; thus, when they are exposed to poor quality of foods, they just enjoy the foods as long as the flavours are satisfying. Second, the development of technology nudges people towards the sedentary lifestyle. Another cause of weight gain is that children are always glued to one screen or the other. Young generation, in particular, has a tendency to spend their pastime on these screens. By doing so, they cut down on their physical activities and have been gaining more weight than they need.  In conclusion, it is evident that more and more children suffer from childhood obesity, which could trigger health and financial problems later in their life. I content that technology is the main culprit here encouraging the sedentary lifestyle and unhealthy food habits. ",8,True,91.70518779047859,255
"It is often argued that violent programmes on television and the internet influence people to commit crime and incite violence. I completely agree with this opinion. In this essay, I will be analysing the negative impacts of media on the society before arriving at a conclusion. Firstly, people tend to believe that brutality shown in movies is heroic and they imitate them blindly. Film stars perform stunts and crimes in their movies, making the audience believe that such activities are essential to become a super human. Viewers are influenced when they watch actors perform violent activities on screen. For example, there are many reports of people committing crimes as a result of watching crime thriller films. These audience turned criminals plot their brutal acts by imitating what they saw in such movies. Secondly certain kind of media allows people to form groups, which can be misused as a platform to spread hatred among people. Social media such as Facebook and Whatsapp have features that allow users to communicate and spread violence without any censorship. Issues like religious intolerance and racial discrimination often hurt individual sentiments. Consequently, people become selfish and they start hating each other. For example, nowadays, terrorists use social media to brainwash people to perform violent activities such as bombing and explosions. In conclusion, different forms of media like movies and social media promote brutality as people get inspired and brainwashed by its contents.",8,True,95.40786464011629,236
"There is a common trend among female students to prefer art subjects and male students to prefer science subjects at university. This tendency results from the existence of gender based stereotypes. For example, when we hear the word doctor or engineer we automatically think of a man. However, it needs to be changed. In this essay, I will deal with this common practice in detail and explain why it should be changed. For a long time, people have believed that the female brain is evolved to be suitable for art subjects while the male brain is suitable for science subjects. Consequently, parents encourage their sons to choose streams like medicine or engineering and daughters to choose literature or music. However, there is no scientific background to support this belief. It means that this is a stereotype and myth. As we can see, lots of men have gained name and recognition as artists, musicians and authors. Likewise, lots of women have become successful architects, scientists and engineers. For this reason, this myth needs to be busted because it is preventing / discouraging some women who are very talented in science from contributing to science. It is quite disadvantageous to the persons concerned and also to their country. In conclusion, there is no scientific reason for their belief. Thus, it should change so that the talented students are able to contribute to the field that they are good at and earn success and prosperity for themselves and their nations.",8,True,69.5710636154289,246
"Although the world is making great progress across all aspects of life, one particular area that greatly suffers and keeps worsening is income inequality. If proper measures are not taken to alleviate this problem, it will not only hamper the development of mankind but also have serious implications for the success of various nations. An income divide is detrimental to global growth. Firstly, it causes great distress and unrest in the nations. Because of the wide gap between the rich and the poor, there is a feeling of hostility in the minds of the poor and this often translates to societal unrest.  This divide can really cause a never-ending social calamity whose effects can be so detrimental that they can affect generations to come. Secondly, income divide can hamper the development of the nation. For instance, India and China have been termed as developing nations since ages. One of the main reasons of this prolonged status as a “developing nation” is the widespread income inequality, and unless measures are taken to alleviate the income divide these nations will never attain the “developed nation” status. Although nations cannot stop the rich from getting richer, what they can do is to devise successful ways of overcoming the problems of poverty. Education goes a long way in treating many social diseases and hence free or subsidized education to the poor can help alleviate poverty to a large extent. This education should go beyond pure academics and teach moral and humanitarian values to the poor, which will help ease out the feelings of hostility towards the rich. Government can also open schemes where the rich industrialists are allowed to adopt poverty-stricken areas. This way the rich can take up development work in the area and thus improve the condition of the poor and make them happy in their surroundings. In conclusion, although the income inequality is rising it can be dealt with by creating programs which can help uplift the poor thus creating an overall positive environment.

"It is commonly believed that preservation of natural resources is imperative, yet most people seem to exert no effort in doing so. Understanding the causes of this negligent attitude may help with devising some simple measures to safeguard the deteriorating environment.Lack of awareness is probably the foremost reason why the vast majority of individuals appears to be unmindful of the current environmental issues. Normally, people have tendency to downplay abstract problems, or those  to happen in the distant future. This is because they are not properly informed of the possible detrimental effects of taking the environment for granted. To illustrate, residents in urban areas often deliberately dump their  into the nearby creeks and drainage canals causing them to become clogged. It is only when devastating floods strike, that they come to realize the consequences of their actions.Some basic solutions that could be carried out are extensive awareness  through all forms of communication and strict implementation of waste management. In addition to the traditional press, social media is a powerful means of disseminating information regarding the impending disasters and their potential hazards. This is a good way of persuading the public to actively take part in the campaign. Another straightforward solution, and by far the least anyone can do to help save the nature is disposing of garbage thoughtfully. Apart from avoiding throwing trash anywhere, everyone should practice proper segregation of biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable wastes at all times. These actions, when coordinated by the local governments, can be tremendously successful.In conclusion, while individual awareness is key to maintaining a healthy ecosystem, concerted efforts of governments and  are much more effective in achieving such goal.",8,True,140.73151750972764,274
"Some people believe that the majority of artists earn low salaries and hence government funding is necessary for them to continue with their profession. I strongly disagree with this statement because of the reasons mentioned below. Most of the talented artists are earning good salary. In any field of art, hardworking and skilful artists have successful life with enough fame and money. More specifically, actors, painters, writers and dancers are getting good remuneration for their performance. Paintings of good painters are sold for a great deal of money. It is well known to the public that dancers and actors lead highly luxurious lives. Government funding is not at all required for these artists. Most of the artists are leading good standard life compared to many other people in the society.  In other words, there are many sections of people who are really poor and actually need some help from the government to meet their basic needs such as food, clothes and education. For example, there are many people who do not have a proper house to stay in. Road workers and construction workers are earning low wages. There are many families where there are sick males who are unable to do any job. So, the government should give its help and support to these poorer sections of the society. Another argument against giving financial aid to artists is that most of them have some sort of university education. So if they are not able to earn as much as they want, they can do some other job to supplement their income. In conclusion, artists are getting enough income and government support is not mandatory for them. Therefore I strongly disagree with the statement.",7,True,72.19275942178626,283
"In this era of globalisation, the migration of the educated individuals to the first world countries is a common phenomenon. According to many people, the major reason behind this development is the better lifestyle and handsome salaries available in developed countries. In this essay, I shall elucidate the adverse ramifications of this development on a developing nation and the possible solutions to mitigate the far-reaching impact of this situation. The consequences due to the shortage of skilled workers are inevitable for the poor nations. The paucity of skilled medical professionals in hospitals will deprive their citizens of quality medical services on time. A nation cannot become prosperous, if there is a shortage of skilled manpower. Moreover, the migration of qualified workers to a developed nation is a wastage of government resources. In India, for instance, the government spends on average 50 lakh rupees on a medical student and that investment goes in vain, when that doctor migrates to a different country for the better opportunities.  To curb this outflux of professionals to developed countries, the government ought to provide better facilities to these qualified individuals. The most effective way to halt this development is to provide them better remuneration. The brain drain phenomenon can be controlled, if these professionals get salaries commensurate with these qualifications. Besides this, the society should give them the respect they deserve. Often times, the society looks down upon educated youth who cannot find a job that suits their qualifications in their own country. This also forces them to go abroad where they are more likely to get a decent job. In conclusion, the migration of qualified professionals to the developed nations leave serious adverse impact on the society and the government both. However, to combat this situation, the authorities must provide them better remuneration.. ",8,True,63.72903353296287,298
"Many people strive hard to be successful in business. There are many indicators of a successful business. A business that reaps more profits is generally thought to be more successful, but in my opinion, money is not the only parameter of success. Firstly, it must be agreed upon that making money is one of the primary motives behind starting any new business. Every individual wants to make a good deal of profits out of his investment. Also, a company’s annual profits are very important to pull in other investors into that business and thus achieve its expansion and growth. So, there is no question about money being one of the indicators of success. Having said that, money is not the only measure / indicator of success. There are other important indicators of a successful business. First comes employee satisfaction. A business may make huge amounts of money but if its employees are unhappy, it is worthless. Also, employee unhappiness will eventually lead to the failure of a company. Secondly, earning name and fame is more important than making money. There are many businessmen who earn respect in the society irrespective of their business turnovers. This is because of the trust they have built over years. Last but not least, customer satisfaction is also an important measure of a successful business. To conclude, even though profits are an important indicator of success, in my opinion, the reputation and goodwill that a company enjoys are equally if not more important. After all, only a business that earns the loyalty of its employees and customers can stay profitable in the long term. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Speaking in front of an audience is a skill which is not possessed by many. Most of the people find it tough to speak or give a presentation in a public forum. This essay will delve into the reasons behind such difficulties and discuss why this skill should be taught as a part of school curriculum. To begin with, we humans are conscious about others’ feelings towards us, and are constantly looking to maintain a healthy relation with everybody. Most of us are also not very confident of our knowledge and wisdom. So, when someone is giving a lecture or a presentation to a house full of audience, in the hope of establishing his positive qualities, he loses his fluency and sometimes ends up providing wrong information. Looking confident on such a platform is another important trait, and in most of the cases it is evident that the speaker lacks this charm. Without the skill to interest the audience, it becomes impossible to continue the session for long. So, to keep the listeners active and focused, public speaking skill is hugely important. Since it is extremely important to develop public speaking skills, teaching them at school is the most effective way.   They should be motivated regularly to look beyond their mistakes and concentrate on speaking with fluency and coherence. If they are nurtured daily, they will definitely become engaging speakers others find easy to converse with. This will also help them land good job opportunities in various sectors. Who knows that some of the students may even become influential social activists like Martin Luther King or Mahatma Gandhi, who can inspire the countrymen to achieve great success by their words. To sum up, public speaking should definitely be taught in school and given equal importance like any other subjects. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Museums are educational places which are beneficial for people in societies. However, these days, people have to pay an entrance fee to enter many museums. Although this phenomenon can lead to negative effects, I believe that there are  more positive effects.It cannot be denied that price of tickets can bring about detrimental impacts to people, societies, and the museums themselves. From people’s perspective, they are discouraged to visit the museum and not able to access useful information and knowledge freely, particularly the poor because they cannot afford such amount. From societies’ perspective, citizens have fewer opportunities to access vitally significant places to learn history, science, art, and many other essential subjects. From museums’ perspective, they cannot attain one of their objectives to educate people. Moreover, they may have to close down as they lose more of their customers.Despite aforementioned disadvantages, I am convinced that  brings about a myriad of advantages. Firstly, museums will have money to operate which covers their business overhead such as personnel cost, , electricity and water bills. Secondly, the museums can generate their own revenue to improve the place effectively to attract people, for example, to update their exhibits and keep the place clean and good-looking. Having visited many museums myself, I have learnt that many museums which sell tickets are better than those that do not charge for tickets in terms of places, information, and management.In conclusion, although I recognize that the museums ticket sales can cause drawbacks to stakeholders in societies, I believe that museums should not remain free for all so as to be operated and developed most effectively.",8,True,92.56717501815541,265
"The unprecedented advancements in technological and industrial fields have resulted in gigantic changes in the workplace. In the current scenario, the workforce is hired on a temporary basis unlike in the past when jobs were permanent and long-lasting. There are a number of advantages as well as disadvantages to such short-term contract employment and they are discussed below. Contract jobs mainly benefit the organization. To start with, the biggest advantage of contractual jobs is that the employees learn and adapt to evolving needs of the industry. Since there is cut-throat competition for the limited jobs, the workers are bound to update their knowledge from time-to-time to stay relevant in such a work environment. They also learn to multi-task. Furthermore, the time constraints encourage workers to come out of their comfort zone and work even harder so that their contracts will be extended further. On the flip side, employees do not gain much from short-term contract jobs. The first and foremost disadvantage is that such jobs are highly insecure. Workers live in constant / perpetual fear of losing their work and this affects their performance. Also, there is usually high competition owing to limited work opportunities. In addition, contract jobs may result in higher levels of unemployment in an economy.

"It is an undeniable fact that humans have significantly damaged the ecological balance of flora and fauna. Although some people opine that there exist no remedies to initiate a change, I believe that it is still possible to reverse these adverse impacts on the environment. This essay will discuss the former and the latter arguments in detail. To begin with, some people believe that nothing much can be done to reverse the damage caused to the nature. This is because the governments are not taking enough initiative to curb the overuse of fossil fuels and reduce the deforestation. For example, it was reported by International Organisation for Climate Change that the damage caused by global warming is irreversible because most of the governments have failed to act seriously. However, the government can improve the situation by amending the law and making it more stringent by including penal provisions.  However, I am of the view that that there are a lot of measures which can still be undertaken by the government and people to reverse the adverse effects. The government should make policies to reduce the consumption of plastic and fossil fuels. As a result, there will be less pollution and these measures will gradually lead to recovery of the mother-nature. To illustrate, countries like Bhutan has completely eradicated the consumption of plastic and since then there has been a significant improvement in the growth of flora and fauna. Thus, these actions can help to undo the harm caused to the environment.  To conclude, despite the fact that some people may not have any hopes in relation to the improvement of the environment due to the lack of efforts taken by the government, I believe that there are a plethora of options available such as implementing stricter polices and curbing the usage of plastic to overcome these issues.

"Some people believe that watching television is not good for children while there are many others who believe that television is informative and educational for children. I firmly agree with the latter statement but in my opinion parents should decide which shows their children should watch. On the one hand, several lines of evidence suggest that television is informative and educational for children. To begin with, shows like world discovery broadcasted on television help children to learn about new inventions. Furthermore, watching programs is an informative way of entertainment for children. For example, my son absolutely loves watching programmes on National Geographic/Discovery/BBC Earth. Many of these programmes have even helped him with his school assignments. He is not really into reading, but these shows give him the knowledge and information he needs. However, television can be informative and educational only when parents decide which shows their children should watch. There are many shows broadcasted on television which can be unsuitable for children. Firstly, there are some shows which are related to violence, drugs and sex. These shows spoil the mindset of children. Secondly, young children blindly follow some characters and learn violent attitude from them. For instance, in the recent past there were many reports about crimes committed by teenagers. Investigations revealed that many of them had the habit of watching violent shows on television. Inspired by these programmes they plotted crimes. This is a good example of the harmful impact of television programmes on children. Thus it goes without saying that parents can make television either destructive or constructive for children. To conclude, although television programmes can be informative for children parents should help them choose the right programmes.

"These days, many teenagers do part-time jobs. While part time jobs certainly offer some benefits such as financial independence and real life work experience, their drawbacks cannot be overlooked. For example, a part time job may deflect / divert children from their true career path. In this essay, I will explore both the advantages and disadvantages of part time jobs with relevant examples. One of the significant benefits for students to have a part-time job is that they can lend a helping hand to their parents financially, or they can afford their own tuition fees for higher education. For example, most of the higher education courses, these days, are expensive, and it is a burden for parents to fund their children. Also, a part time job will give real world exposure to children. This can be an advantage when they go for higher studies. For instance, some universities prefer to admit students who have some amount of work experience. However, there are certain drawbacks to doing a part time job. For example, children who have a part time job may lose their interest in further studies. When kids have financial freedom at such a tender, sometimes they might not take studies seriously and get deviated from their goal. Surveys have shown that about 10 percent of high school children who drop-out and discontinue higher studies, have part-time jobs. After both sides of the argument, it is not hard to see that part time jobs certainly offer some benefits to young people; however, the drawbacks of working at a young age cannot be overlooked. Students should have a clear vision of their goals and should not neglect their studies, and understand that part-time jobs only provide temporary financial security.

"People have different opinions on whether home-schooling or a formal education would be a better option for children. While I agree that attending local schools would enhance a child’s social communication skills, I believe that applying the ‘home-schooling method’ up to a certain age would bring benefits in other perspectives. In this essay, I will discuss the plus points of both approaches and share my view. To begin with, children learn more than just academic knowledge by turning up to schools. The traditional education system promotes a balanced curriculum, covering the other non-academic areas including arts, music, sports and more. As result, children are guided to discover their unique talents, which parents could then continue to nurture. Furthermore, learning in a classroom enables children to interact with their classmates, and at the same time, understanding the importance of teamwork. In my opinion, these group activities would frame their personal traits to tolerate and care for the others as they grow up. On the other hand, home-schooling might be beneficial in the earlier stage as parents could tailor the curriculum and emphasise on the areas that their child are weaker in. For example, one child might face difficulties in math while most of their classmates find challenges in literacy skills. With the home-schooling system, children are pardoned to not keep up with the learning progress of the majorities. In addition, learning at home during the earlier stages could save children from getting in touch with possible negative influences in school. In conclusion, I believe that both methods possess their own advantages and parents should take into account their child’s personality when making the choices. As for myself, I would first teach my children at home and only send them to school around the age of 10.",7,True,105.5312673557447,294
"The following is an essay submitted by one of our students. It seems to be a band 7.5 essay. With the growth of technology in the travel industry, travelling to other countries has increased at rapid speed. Countries have disparate set of customs and interpretation of behaviour. The visitors should be allowed to follow their own customs and behaviour but they must be wary of offending local customs and beliefs. In my opinion, we should develop world as global village to create unity in diversity. The focal point of humanity should be moral values which are common in all regions rather than customs and behaviors which are diverse in different regions. If a host country cannot entertain the culture of visitors then its participation with other countries in economic, financial and other activities will be hampered. South Asian country India is the best example of unity in diversity. There people from all the religions live peacefully and even visitors from other countries can follow their own culture. In my opinion, it is the moral responsibility of visitors to respect important beliefs and customs of their host country. Different countries could have different interpretation of the same practice. It is very much important for the visitors to know some practices the places they visit so that they don’t hurt sentiments or misinterpret behaviour of local people. A good example of cultural differences is the eating habits in India. In India people always prefer to eat with their hands which is considered as inferior in some western countries. Therefore, if a western person is visiting India, he must be aware of this and not feel offended. In conclusion, we can say that culture is basically a set of rules followed by people which may vary in different countries. Furthermore cultural practices can’t be used as a tool to measure morality or character of a person. In my opinion, host nations should understand that visitors may have different cultures.

"You should spend about 40 minutes on this task. Write at least 25o words In the recent years , there has been an intense debate in all judicial systems across the world over the fact that punishments should commensurate crime .Many people reckon that juveniles committing serious crimes should be penalized in the same way as adults . I strongly support that for heinous and serious crimes even the youngsters should be prosecuted in the same way as adult offenders . To start with , the most compelling reason for support is that serious punishment for serious crime will deter them and other young criminals from offences . Serious crimes like murder, outraging the modesty of females, child molestation and anti-national activities are so severe, that even if performed by teenagers, deserve rigorous action so that it can serve as an example not only for them but also for other youths with criminal bent of mind. Lighter penalty, like sending them to reform-house, in such grievous acts will propagate crime while stringent action will prevent them from even planning the crime . For instance, a report published in Criminal Survey, a famous Law journal in 2011 revealed that 40 percent of juvenile delinquents repeat the crime when send to reform houses as against only 10 percent flouting laws when no special privilege is being given on the basis of age . Moreover , punishment proportionate to crime gives a sense of justice for the bereaved family. Most of the grief- stricken families, who have lost their near and dear ones, hope that offenders should be punished in a similar way.

"Education is the powerful weapon which can be used to change the world. It paves the way to a more civilised and developed society. In this context, it is observed that girls prefer art subjects,  whereas boys choose science for their higher studies / or at university. This trend has the roots submerged in various aspects and in my opinion / perspective a change needs to be introduced at the academic level. The major catalyst contributing towards this trend is the mental conditioning of the children by the parents and teachers. For instance, girls are considered appropriate for household chores and for doing any subtle work of art as it is perceived in many developing countries that girls will become housewives and will take care of their families. On the other hand, boys are thought to be destructive and inquisitive by nature. They take keen interest in technology and mechanics and have critical thinking ability. Moreover, science subjects provide better job opportunities. Hence, parents push them to take these subjects as they see them as their only breadwinner. In my opinion, this trend has to be changed with the change in time and age. The most effective solution is to educate parents and motivate them to create a level playing field for both genders. The parents should be made aware of the job prospects in both the fields. There should not be any peer pressure on children to take a particular subject. It is observed that it is not the subject which brings fame and money but it is the interest in the subject which helps to reach the pinnacle. Therefore, conservative thinking needs to change.  The aforementioned discussion boils down to the fact that a subject should be recommended to children only after taking into account their interest. Instead of interfering with their choices, the parents should give equal treatment to all the children irrespective of their gender for the prosperous life ahead.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Sample essay The internet has revolutionized our lives. It has changed the way we communicate and research. According to some people, the internet is a great communication tool but it is not a reliable source of information. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, the internet is not only an excellent communication tool but also a treasure trove of information. The internet has given us access to a vast pool of information. In fact, anyone who has access to a smart phone and an internet connection can now find information on just about any subject within a matter of seconds. This ease of finding information online has even made physical libraries redundant. The main problem with finding information online is that we cannot always trust the source. The internet allows anyone and everyone to be a writer and a publisher. You can blog on any topic; you can post your opinions on any subjects. No one will ask you whether you are qualified to do so. As a result, some of the information that we find online is not very reliable. This, however, does not mean that all the information on the internet is erroneous. While I admit that it is possible to find factually incorrect information on some lesser known websites, blogs and forums, the truth is that the vast majority of these unreliable sources do not make it to search results. When you do a Google search for a particular keyword, the websites that pop up are authority sites that do their research before posting information online. Take, for instance, the case of online encyclopedia Wikipedia. Anyone can edit it so we might think that it will contain a lot of mistakes. On the contrary, Wikipedia does not contain any more errors than the celebrated Encyclopedia Britannica because it has committed editors and writers who want to provide the most authentic information to their readers.

"Throwing parties can be expensive. While some people do not find these fancy gatherings worth what they cost, others believe such events are important to both individuals and the society.People choose to throw parties for a number of reasons. For starters, they can make better teams. Project kick-off parties are good opportunities to break the ice and help team members to know each other better. Celebrating a victory create a sense of success and belonging. Companies do not see parties as  of money and allocate budget to support such events; moreover, they often leave good memories. From our own experiences, we all have happy memories of our birthday parties when we were little. Every family has great photos  at family gatherings in their album. In addition, contrary to what some people believe that spending on parties is a waste of social resources, they actually create value, either by employing people in the party-planning business or by offering people better experiences.The popularity of parties, however, causes some tension in the society. They are hard on introverted people who find themselves uncomfortable in the crowd. This is a clinic symptom which psychologists call  “social anxiety disorder”. There are other ways to celebrate important events that may have greater value for their cost. For instance, companies could send out gifts after successful projects and parents could take their children on family trips to celebrate birthdays.In my opinion, while a party is a form of social event that brings many benefits to individuals and the society, other choices should also be considered, either to cut spending or to relieve the stress of those who are not fond of crowded celebrations.",8,True,114.26020244977258,276
"Some people believe that the advantages of being a celebrity outweigh the disadvantages. I completely agree with this statement because the benefits that come with being a celebrity are numerous; however there are also some drawbacks. Both advantages and disadvantages will be discussed in this essay. To start with, the main disadvantage of being a celebrity is that they are constantly in the public eye and hence they cannot enjoy the sort of privacy that an ordinary person enjoys. Celebrities are easily recognized by their fans, critics and the media. Consequently, they have to be careful / cautious especially when they are in public places. Recently, it has been observed that the media take advantage of the popularity of celebrities. For example, newspapers, magazines and television channels enhance their readership or viewership by publishing stories related to the personal life of celebrities. Some even go to the extent of fabricating catchy, defamatory and false stories about celebrities to promote the sales of their works.  To be honest, this is unfair to the celebrities. However, despite the drawbacks, the benefits of being a celebrity are many. The feeling that comes with the fame, and the knowledge that people recognize and appreciate you for the work you do is awesome and great. In addition, Celebrities are being hired / signed for endorsing products and services. They are known to have a large fan base and hence they are employed as ambassadors by politicians during election campaigns to win votes. They are well rewarded in cash or kind. In conclusion, after analysing both aspects of the situation it is not hard to see that there are more benefits than disadvantages to being a celebrity. The main problem that celebrities face is the intrusion into their privacy. However, the advantages such as financial gains, public recognition and appreciation make any disadvantages pale in comparison.",8,True,46.84518197647259,308
"Culture is the same throughout the world. This essay will discuss the reasons for it and shed some light on whether it is a positive or a negative trend. There are many reasons why culture is becoming the same. Firstly, globalisation has taken over the world. This means that international markets have made their presence in every nook and corner of the planet. As a result, the same things are available to people. Traveling is another reason for this. When someone travels they adopt the culture of that place and bring it back to their home country. Take pottery as an example. This art form has travelled all the way through India to Sri Lanka. Now pottery is a part of Sri Lankan culture.  Online shopping is another factor contributing to this.  Due to the internet, buying items online has become easy. Global products are available from the comfort of one’s home. For instance, Amazon.com has a specified category for international products. This enables the customer to buy products related to other cultures when needed. In my opinion, this is a negative trend. One of the main reasons is the loss of traditional art and culture. Younger generation, for example, is more attracted towards the glitz and glam of international world. To show off in front of their peers, they value and adopt the culture of other countries. Due to this they do not intend to learn about their own country’s heritage or culture. Furthermore, loss of traditional culture, art and heritage leads to loss of cultural identity. In conclusion, considering the aforementioned view, in my opinion, cultures becoming the same is a negative trend as it leads to loss of cultural identity that makes each nation unique.

"Some people think that by being highly dependent on digital devices, young people are losing their reading and writing skills. I beg to differ! In my opinion, people get to read and write more by using these devices and “practice makes perfect!” The digital world has made people to become more interconnected. Within minutes, one is able to send a handful of messages. This encourages people to write more to avoid wasting time on phone calls or face-to-face meetings. In fact, the diverse types of writing that we make can improve different aspects of our writing. For example, when we text our friends, we use informal language such as using contractions. However, we use a more formal tone when messaging our manager. Similarly, digitized data enhances our reading skills. Day in and day out, we are bombarded by multitude of information in text form.  Thanks to social media, people would share anything interesting with everyone they know, and it would cost them almost nothing. Hence, most people prefer to read their cluttered inboxes or social media messages during any waiting time such as commuting or standing in a queue. Although they may not realize it, this time is actually being invested by strengthening many soft skills such as reading. In short, contrary to the belief that interacting through screens harms our literary skills, I believe that by doing so we are effectively improving our reading and writing skills.",7,True,89.13907531692766,238
"In today’s technology driven world, humans are completely falling behind the computers in terms of intelligence. While some believe that this is a progressive development, others apprehend that it can have adverse impact on the society. In my opinion, advancement of technology is a boon for the people; however, its demerits should be taken into consideration. To begin with, when computers become more intelligent / more advanced, it is certainly beneficial for humans. For instance, now operating business from home has become so easy and convenient as everything is interconnected through internet. Thus it saves time and money on constructing mammoth setups. Besides this, computer machines such as robots have entered into health care sector. Many surgeons use robots for surgeries as they are fast, precise, and more accurate. Consequently, this can reduce workload of doctors, eventually, giving them some leisure time. Furthermore, robots can work in extreme environment conditions where humans cannot work. For example, automated machines can easily function in nuclear power plants as they are resistant to radiations, thus saving lives of many people. However, many fear that intelligent computers are a bane for the society. These super computers can be hired to work in industries instead of humans. Therefore, it will lead to an exponential rise in the unemployment rate thereby increasing crime and unrest In a nation. Secondly, an error in their programming system can have devastating effect on the security of the country. To illustrate, countries can become vulnerable to external threats, if sensitive information is leaked online through hacking. Although an advanced computer technology has some negative repercussions, I personally believe that this is the most important development for mankind as it has several benefits in various fields. To conclude, it is quite evident from the above discussion that the technology is here to stay. Nevertheless, over dependence on anything can be dangerous. So, a cautious approach is needed while operating them. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate. ",8,True,116.73821588210085,338
"Humans have been trying to create an equitable community for years. In an ideal society everyone will have equal rights and no one will be discriminated against. I believe that people’s attitude towards others could make a huge difference in making a society more perfect. In a perfect society, there should be no discrimination on the basis of religion, culture and color. In this day and age, it is common to see conflicts between people belonging to different communities in every part of the world. When there is no partiality for or against any faction of the society, this world would be a better place to live in. Another prominent factor is that there ought to be equal rights for men and women. For instance, outside the developed world, there are still some nations where gender disparities can be seen easily, even though women are as capable as men in every field. Changing people’s attitude towards one another is the only way to create an ideal society. Firstly, people should treat everyone equally regardless of their financial status. For example, in today’s world, some people give more respect to the affluent sections of the society and treat others with disdain. Secondly, people can do community services to provide help to the needy. These services can be provided either by donating money or giving their valuable time. Such simple acts can help to achieve a perfect society. To conclude, in a perfect society, there should be no discrimination based on gender, religion and culture. Also, treating others with kindness and respect is what we can do to create a better society.

"Despite fossil fuels being the prominent source of energy in the world people are motivated to replace them with wind energy, solar energy etc. It is a positive development because alternative energy is cheap, affordable, and convenient and emission from these sources is not as harmful as fossil fuel emissions. Natural resources are considered as a god’s gift and if we continue to exploit fossil fuels they will be exhausted in near time. For example, excessive consumption of petrol and diesel has led to the depletion of their reserves. According to some studies, if oil is consumed at the present rate, we will run out of its supply in about 50 years. Since energy is crucial for the development of any nation, it is essential that we invest in other sources like solar and wind.  Another reason to invest in alternative energy is that it is eco-friendly. For example, wind or solar does not cause any pollution. By contrast, emission from fossil fuels is very hazardous to environment and they contribute to 65% of carbon footprints around the world. Pollution is increasing day by day due to the use of these fossil fuels. Environmentalists have pronounced that if we continue to pollute the environment there is danger that polar ice caps will melt resulting in serious consequences. In conclusion, fossil fuels are natural but there should be a limit to the extent they can be used as they cause pollution. Government bodies should encourage people to use wind and solar energy because they are environment friendly and sustainable in the long term. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Women have been playing a vital role in civilization and development of the country . Women are working in every field and they have proved that they can do different tasks as well as men. Therefore, some people think that women should be allowed to work in different fields in the armed forces such as navy and air force.                                                                      To commence with, women have the ability to work in every field of life.Those days are gone when women were considered to be weak member of society. Now women are working in all kinds of sectors such as blue and white collar jobs,sports,aviation and even in police departments. By working in police departments they have proven that they can take riskier types of jobs and can perform their task brilliantly. Hence, allowing females to work in defence sector can improve the sense of equality and unity among both genders and can improve the working environment. Therefore, many people emphasis that they should be allowed to work in the army. In addition, giving opportunities to female can uplift their self-esteem and respect in the society.                                                                                                                                                         On the other hand, many people have conflicting views. Women are generally less stronger than men and are more sensitive therefore, working in the army department will not be a piece of cake for them. Furthermore, women have to give births to children and to nurture them. For that they need maternity leaves which cannot be possible during the days of war. Also, jobs  in the army requires making brave decisions such as taking someone’s life which is not possible for women because they have emotional nature. Women can join the supportive and transportation department of the country if they want to serve for the country and protect their nation . These jobs are as essential as fighting in the battleground.

"Everyone wants to be a famous actor or cricketer. The life a celebrity lives / has is filled with so much grandeur and class that everyone aspires to be famous. Some of the key advantages of being a celebrity is that you earn a lot of money and people admire you. However, there are some disadvantages too. For example, famous people do not have enough privacy and they are more likely to get into scandals.   In my opinion, while everyone aspires to be a celebrity not everyone can become a celebrity so the advantages far supersede the disadvantages. Celebrities earn millions of dollars by endorsing brands or working in movies. For instance, A-list actors such as Jennifer Lopez, Tom Cruise and Amitabh Bachchan earn around $10-50 million in a year. Amtitabh Bachchan charges INR 20 million for one brand endorsement; despite working 8-9 hours a day round the year ordinary people will not be able to earn that much in a lifetime. Another benefit is the constant admiration and fan-following of millions of people across the globe. Fans celebrate celebrity birthdays, shower them with presents and appreciation letters. Some even get tattoos of their favorite celebrity thus, making celebrities feel loved and supported. However, being famous is like a double-edged sword. Celebrities are in constant limelight with the paparazzi following them round the clock and this leaves no room for private life. Fans keep a constant watch on celebrities and their family members and due to this they have to be conscious of their behaviour all the time.  For instance, a celebrity cannot use abusive or harsh language since he will be looked down upon whereas an ordinary person can demonstrate such behaviour and it is considered acceptable. Another drawback is that people are constantly writing about celebrities without checking the facts. News which is scandalous and negative in nature often gets more coverage in magazines and newspapers  because it helps to sell more copies. In conclusion, being a celebrity and maintaining a sophisticated lifestyle is not everyone’s cup of tea and hence, only a few make the cut and truly shine out. Just as a coin has two sides, being a celebrity too has its shortcomings; however, it is a small price to pay for living an extravagant life and being admired by people.

"While many people believe that a day without cars across the world is a helpful way to increase the air quality, others are of the opinion that we should adopt other ways to preserve our environment and reduce air pollution. In this essay, I will delve into both views and provide my support for the latter view.   It is evident that actions which reduce the consumption of fossil fuels is good for the environment. Nowadays, a large number of people are ready to get back to nature and start caring about our planet more. I believe that actions like “a day-off from cars” will bring results, because people have already achieved positive outcomes with a similar initiative called “Earth Hour” during which people turn off electric lights for an hour in order to show their commitment to protect Mother Earth. People are getting more and more informed about the negative impact of air pollution on their health and the health of future generations.   Despite knowing that this initiative / idea can be helpful, I think it is not enough and preventive measures should be taken more comprehensively involving government support. It has to fund scientific research into eco-friendly products and inventions.  For example, Europe is already noticing the beneficial effects on the environment after the invention of electric cars. Although these vehicles are more expensive than petrol cars, people are buying them to protect our environment, especially air, from pollution.   To conclude, I believe that an international car-free day can be helpful for our planet and help people aware of the need to protect it. Even so, in my opinion, a better option is to invest in eco-friendly cars that do not consume petrol.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Although the demand for housing is increasing, there is no open space available for their construction except in the countryside. However, some people argue that the countryside should be protected from construction activity. I disagree with them. In my opinion, it is important to build homes on the outskirts of cities.  First and foremost, cities have become over crowded due to urbanization and free space is only available in the countryside. More and more people are migrating to cities for a better future and hence the space available for construction has already been used. To meet this demand for land, people are turning to the countryside. Many customers also want to buy homes in the countryside because they are more affordable. Also, pollution is not really an issue in rural areas. Hence, people opting to live in the countryside can buy spacious homes built amidst natural greenery. In addition to this, if construction is done in the areas away from the city we can reduce the negative effects of urbanization. Due to overcrowding in cities, people face not only traffic congestion but also pollution. For example, in a South Indian city, a 40% improvement in air quality was observed after they started building homes in the peripheral areas of the city instead of in the centre. Thus, to improve the quality of life in the urban area it is a better solution.   However, there should be strict rules regarding the construction of homes in the countryside. Homes should be built with proper ventilation and there should be vegetation zones and free spaces between houses to prevent the bad impact of construction in those areas.  In conclusion, as population is continuously moving to cities for better prospects, there is a simultaneous increase in the demand for shelters. Therefore, the countryside can be utilised for this purpose and to curb the effects of overcrowding in cities. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In the world we live in today, people are more interested in sports played by men. In my opinion, this is an adverse trend. This essay will discuss how this over emphasis on male sports decreases interest of women in games and impacts their image in the society. Attention and encouragement play a vital role in a person’s growth. When the female players do not get the same kind of treatment like male players do, they lose their morale and enthusiasm, since they know that no matter how hard they try, they will not get the same attention that men do In a recent study in Canada it was found that only 30% of women are interested in sports leagues and the rest cannot find a valid reason to participate. Also, the lack of interest in female sports creates a wrong impression about the capabilities of a woman. Since women are not treated the same way as men in sports, people misjudge them and think they might not have the same talent that men have. If women are not given the chance to prove themselves, there is no way they can showcase their capabilities. For instance, in 2015 when the Men’s World Cup Cricket was played people had high hopes on the Indian team but they lost it. Immediately after, Indian women’s team won the world cup for which they did not get the much-deserved appreciation. To recapitulate, when men’s sports gain more attention than women’s sports, it has a negative impact on the society as it not only brings down the enthusiasm of the women but also portrays them as weak and incapable.

"It is often debated whether people should plan for the future or simply live in the moment. I believe that both statements have their grounds and I will explain my views in this essay.  To begin with, some people argue that humans should enjoy the present moment and forget about the past and future. I suggest that this view holds true for those who are suffering from terminal illness. For palliative care patients, thinking about the future could be too agonizing and devastating. Therapists often propose that they should experience and focus on the present to reduce their pain. For instance, mindfulness is a form of therapy which guides patients to concentrate on the here and now. Being thankful to the family and friends and feeling blessed for the days that they have lived help the patients forget about the fears of death.  However, contemplating about the future enables people to establish a clearer goal and helps them with personal development. First, when we think about the future, we are more likely to set up goals and have a clearer vision of what we want ourselves to be. Not only will the goals motivate us, but the obstacles that we foresee will also make us less likely to surrender in the face of adversities. In other words, planning enables us to to improve our chances of success in life. Second, deciding what to do in the future is a means to better manage our time and resources. To illustrate, it is almost mandatory for corporations to write proposals when conducting multi-sector projects. They are required to state the timeline and capital clearly to enhance efficient use of resources.  To conclude, I believe both views have their merits. While people who are at their terminal stage of life are advised to experience the present moment to alleviate agony, others should think about and plan for their future to live a more fruitful life.",8,True,80.5,322
"It is undeniably true that planning plays an important role in achieving the objectives. There are some people who would prefer to plan their time activities but there are some who assert that planning is not necessary. I firmly agree with the former statement but in my opinion we may not get a chance to plan things every time and often things happen as a result of spontaneous decisions. On the one hand, several lines of evidence suggest that planning is very essential for any activity. To begin with, there are many people who do not wish to waste time. They believe in carrying on with the free time activities according to a plan for effective execution. Furthermore, sometimes planning is essential to enjoy certain activities. For example, when we are on a holiday we may want to visit a museum or an amusement park. However, these facilities are not open round the clock and hence some planning is essential to be able to access them. Therefore, planning is necessary. For example, in my own experience whenever I plan for vacation during holidays, I plan things in advance so that it gives me time to arrange all the necessary things required during my vacation. This helps me to enjoy the vacation wholeheartedly. On the other hand, there are many people who argue that planning is not at all necessary and free time activities should be decided spontaneously. For example, some people are easy going. They immensely enjoy taking unplanned decisions. Secondly, sometimes planned activities get cancelled because of the sudden occurrence of the problems. This is why some people do things without any planning. In my opinion, planning our free time activities would help us to enjoy our leisure time fully. This aids us to arrange the things required for the execution of our plans. Planning is very crucial to make the event successful. This practice can also help us to save the amount needed. For instance, in my own experience when I plan my vacation in advance I usually get good deals on hotels and flight tickets. To conclude, planning provides us many benefits. It helps us to enjoy the free time activities fully. Planning helps in executing the event successfully but there are situations where we should keep ourselves ready for unplanned activities.

"There is a noticeable difference in the number of male and female students at universities. Some people believe it is necessary that there should be an equal number of male and female students in every course / class, while there are many who are against this idea due to a number of reasons. I disagree with the proposition that universities should accept equal number of boys and girls because merit and aptitude should be given more importance than gender. The whole idea of equal number of men and women in every field is illogical. To start with, all universities should accept people based on merit and not gender. While the idea of having equal number of men and women may seem to empower women, there can be a situation where women are admitted to universities in spite of lacking what it takes to finish the course. If the seats are reserved based on gender, many meritorious students might not get admission. Thus, we can see how absurd the idea is of admitting equal number of men and women. Just like merit, aptitude is another thing that should be considered while admitting students into a course. Studies have shown that some fields are popular among women than men. For example, courses like nursing, home science have more female applicants. If the seats are reserved equally for both genders, universities might not be able to fill all the seats due to fewer applicants of one gender. This could be disastrous for education system overall.  In conclusion, gender based reservation of seats at university is a bad idea because equality cannot be promoted at the expense of merit. Since universities are the places for learning, the most meritorious students should be the ones getting admission. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"There is no doubt that gas emission from vehicle use poses a major threat to the environment. While I accept that higher fuel costs may discourage people from driving to some extent, I believe that there are better alternatives to address the environmental issues.  It is true that higher fuel prices will raise the travel costs of private car users and therefore encourage them to drive less, and thus reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, increased petrol price also means higher costs for those who travel by public transport and thus make it unaffordable for the poor. Thus, it is obvious that raising the cost of petrol is unlikely to improve the situation.  To deal with air pollution, clean and alternative energies need to be developed and adopted. Current technology has already made electric cars available, which can be both quieter and cleaner to use. By persuading manufacturers and travelers to adopt this new technology, gas emissions can be dramatically reduced and the air pollution can be curtailed. Perhaps a better solution is to encourage the public to take public transport and use bicycle more. This means that governments should make public transport convenient, accessible and affordable to travelers. If there were easy access to underground trains and various bus routes to most places in the cities, there would be less traffic on the roads. By building more bicycle lanes and weather-proof shelters for bicycle parking, governments could not only encourage individuals to travel in a more environment friendly way but also allow them to keep fit. As a result, less traffic on the roads will lead to better air quality for everyone. To conclude, higher fuel costs will not stop people from using their cars for long and it will also affect public transport commuters. Better alternative strategies include developing and utilizing cleaner energies and taking advantage of public transport systems.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some people think that government should take measures regarding the healthy lifestyle of individuals. Others think it must be managed by individuals. Discuss both views and give your opinion. Band 7 essay sample Over the past decade, the healthy lifestyles have become one of the pillars in maintaining and transforming modern societies. Some have opined that authorities should apply restricted measures to encourage individuals to follow appropriate lifestyle, while others see it as an individual responsibility to control their habits and follow those programs. This essay will discuss both point of views. Government authorities such as ministry of public health, promote the deployment of such programs. However, measuring the results is essential in shaping new plans and bridging the gaps. Governments are required to allocate the required budget based on the results achieved. For example, following such programs will reduce the number of patients which in turn will make a significant reduction in the required medical care budget. Another factor why government should apply those measures is its ability to launch and establish health clubs in a large number of cities in addition to the media campaigns that does a great deal of influences on the audience. For example, government can provide healthy food recipes along with the exercises that really help change people style of living. Those examples support the view point of government applying the measures. On the other hand, Individuals are the main factor of following and maintaining their lifestyle healthy. Without their determination, all government efforts would fail. Measures cannot be followed if the person is not convinced with its advantages. For example, a determined person, who is keen to apply that lifestyle, will find the time throughout the day to apply it. Some fitness videos are now available on the internet to maintain your physical fitness within 15 minutes a day. He will be following a healthy meals to get better results for his own sake. Changing those eating habits will dramatically enhance his health and reduce the diseases. To conclude, it is now clear that both Government and individuals are sharing the responsibilities of maintaining healthy lifestyle. In my opinion, it is obviously required to engage and stimulate individuals towards such programs. Such engagement cannot be done without the government support.  ",7,True,85.94097067969791,375

It is also likely that the next century will see similar significant advances.In conclusion, although there have been many different advances in society over the last two hundred years, the fact that so many people have had their lives saved or improved by medical breakthroughs makes it seem incontrovertible that it is these medical advances that have been the most significant.",9,True,88.68184471687098,272
"Some people opine that the huge coverage that celebrities get in media has a negative impact on children. This essay will explain why I believe this statement is true only to a certain extent as this coverage does have some positive effects on children. To begin with, a number of media channels broadcast and write about celebrity sightings and this has indirectly led to a culture promoting fashion. Young people are willing to spend huge amounts of money on costumes and personal care products. Oftentimes this spending is unnecessary and should be discouraged as it does no good to them. Also, the excessive coverage that famous people get often convince young people that achieving name and fame should be the only goal in life. Unfortunately, this perspective on life can cause many young people who fail to achieve stardom fall into the depth of despair. There are also many celebrities who lead a wayward lifestyle. Their young fans often unwittingly emulate the same lifestyle and end up destroying their life and career.   On the other hand, there are also a lot of things that young people can learn from celebrities. Many of these people actually had very ordinary childhoods. They became what they are today through sheer hard work and dedication. When children learn about such celebrities they may also get inspired to work hard and achieve success. Then there are celebrities who support social causes. When media showcase their work, their young fans will be encouraged to come forward and volunteer. In conclusion, although media coverage of celebrities makes children want to ape them blindly, in my opinion, celebrity news also encourages children to work hard to achieve their goals.",8,True,77.47938876197728,281
"It is argued that public health is likely to get worse than it is today in the coming years. I believe this is true because there are many unhealthy habits in the modern society that may contribute to poor health among people. One of the reasons that may decrease the health standards are the unhealthy dietary patterns. In other words, people, nowadays, consume more and more junk food that contain higher amounts of lipids and sugar. As a result of this, more people will suffer from severe health issues such as heart problems and diabetes. As people are unaware of these health hazards, they tend to consume those in higher amounts. Moreover, authorities have not taken enough actions to limit the use of unhealthy food items. As those food items constantly appear on television advertisements, people cannot resist the temptation to buy more and more of these. For instance, food chains such as KFC and McDonalds have huge influence on people, especially, young children who consume these foods regularly. Eventually, this will lead to obesity in people which cause low life expectance. Another reason that will decrease the standards of people’s health is the lack of physical activity. As exercise helps us to burn excess calories, it is essential to have a physically active life. It can be seen that people living in the modern society show lack of concern for physical activity. Even though some people pursue exercise, there are a majority of people who do not do any kind of physical sport or activity. Moreover, the new technological advancements have led people to lead a sedentary life. People spend long hours on their smart phones without engaging in any physical activity. In conclusion, it is true that there is a high probability of health standards declining in future owing to the faulty lifestyle and food habits. It is time people woke up to the danger and took corrective measures.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"The work culture is distinctive in every part of the globe. Hence, some individuals stick to the same company, and others try different options available in the market due to various reasons. However, I believe that it is always productive to explore job opportunities at various organizations whenever that is possible. On the one hand, there are a couple of reasons why one must hold onto the same job throughout their life. Firstly, people in the government sector usually prefer to stay in the same job till the end. Promotion opportunities, in particular, are quite high in this sector and people get smart salaries and status in the society. In multinational companies also the resignation rate is extremely low, and people tend to stick to their jobs for longer. Professionals like doctors who work for state-of-the-art hospitals such as Fortis, tend to work under the same organisation. Because they have built a reputation among their patients, so they get respect and handsome money at the same time. On the flip side, many people do require to switch their jobs. Today’s youth is carrier oriented, and once they pursue higher academic credentials, they change their industries. If a person worked as an optometrist after graduation, they would seek better employment options after a master’s degree or maybe a professional fellowship. It is usually not possible without changing the organisation. Besides, a large number of people do believe that exposure to different industries provides them with options to explore their potentials. Some jobs and industries operate on the local scale, so employee’s experience will also remain restricted. Consequently, they move to get global exposure at international ventures. In conclusion, although switching between industries is in vogue nowadays, mainly in the private sector, some individuals have a conventional approach. They like to retire in the same company where they started. However, in my opinion, it is better to change jobs whenever a good opportunity arises and also when one feels that growth prospects in the current job are bleak. ",8,True,97.67432519664332,336
"Undoubtedly English has become the lingua franca; it is, therefore, suggested that learning any foreign language other than English is merely a squandering of precious time, and English should be taught as an elementary language in all learning institutions across the globe. However, I can only partially agree with this view. While it is true that English offers numerous benefits to people, it is up to each individual to decide which foreign language they want to learn. To start with, the reason why English should be taught globally is that it is spoken and understood worldwide. Those who have a strong command of this language have more lucrative job offers than those who do not possess its knowledge. To cite an example, MNCs have been established in many parts of the world especially in developing nations, and they prefer candidates with fluency in English / flawless communication skills in English. Hence, starting to learn this language at a young age / starting to learn this language early is the only way to grasp it completely. In addition, knowledge of English serves as academic credentials. To elaborate it, a good English user is considered highly knowledgeable in even non- English speaking countries. Furthermore, widespread use of English has made geographical barriers insignificant. These days individuals tend to travel to other countries more than ever before, as this language makes it easier for people to know about the culture and tradition of other lands; consequently, tourism is booming. Therefore, in order to enjoy sightseeing English is vital. Even so, if someone has a passion to learn other foreign languages, it cannot be stated as a waste of time or money. Learning is always useful and has many advantages either directly or indirectly.  In conclusion, learning English certainly has its merits and every student should have the opportunity to master it; however, the argument that learning any other foreign language is a waste of time is absurd because learning is always useful and may offer some benefit or other.

"While some people insist that students should go to a college or university to pursue higher education, others argue that they should start working on their career as soon as they finish high school. In my opinion, both options have their merits and demerits and it is up to the students to decide which option is better for them. There are several benefits to pursuing higher education at university. To start with, university education equips students with the skills required to become a competent professional. For example, one cannot become a doctor or an advocate without going to university because these jobs require specialist skills that can only be obtained from an authorised educational education.  Also, university education increases the knowledge and decision making skills of students. Both qualities will benefit them when they enter the job market. On the flip side, there are several jobs that do not require university education. For example, one doesn’t necessarily need a degree in hotel management to launch one’s own restaurant or food joint. Likewise, one does not require a degree in textiles management or garment designing to start a tailoring unit. More than any academic qualifications what these jobs require is a genuine interest in that field. Actually starting early gives budding entrepreneurs a better opportunity to establish themselves before competition gets tougher. To conclude, while a university degree is a must for certain professions there are sectors that value work experience more. Having said that, university degrees certainly do not hurt the career prospects of a person. Rather it empowers them. In my opinion, it is up to the individual to decide whether they should go to university or find work after leaving school.",9,True,79.08764664627893,283
" The number of people moving overseas has been surging since the last few decades and this development has various repercussions for the motherland. This essay will discuss the root causes of this problem and its adverse effects.  On the one hand, in most of the developing countries, there is an immense issue of unemployment, and these countries are facing the disquieting problem of the brain drain. The highly qualified young generation, in particular, opt to fly abroad, so that they can enhance their career prospects and get top-notch paycheques. Besides, the developed nations do offer an extremely sophisticated lifestyle that lures the folks to migrate.  On the flip side, this trend has numerous after-effects on the society. Firstly, there will be a lack of skilled workers in the mother-land.  If the doctors, nurses or other in-demand professionals, for instance, leave their countries, it will eventually create a shortage of skilled professionals. The resident citizens will get treated by the quacks in such a scenario. Unfortunately, this will hurt the development of the society. Also, when young people move out leaving old people behind, governments will have fewer taxpayers and more dependents, who will need pensions.  In conclusion, talented people are migrating in search of better jobs and lifestyles that are not exactly available in their country. Unfortunately, this migration hurts the development of their mother country by causing a shortage of skilled people to run the industries and other sectors. At the same time, developed nations who receive immigrants benefit from their expertise. ",8,True,92.52257126984054,253
"It is argued that the current workplace demands more younger professionals than older workers because the latter are not adaptive to fast-changing ideas and technologies. I agree with this view to a great extent. While I do admit that young professionals are more comfortable with new technologies, they lack the experience and wisdom of their seniors and for this reason companies also need to retain at least some of their experienced employees.  Workers over fifty years of age are considered the asset of an organization. Their vast experience not only adds value but also helps in the critical decision-making process. Apart from new ideas, every organization needs workers with hands-on experience and a deep understanding of industry specific issues. Thus, obviously, every organization needs at least some experienced senior employees.  However, in this age of technology, experience alone will not suffice. Despite the enriched experience older workers have, the changing dynamics of today’s workplace demand young professionals. Today’s workplace witnesses an unprecedented change which is fast and requires quick adaptation. With the continuous technical advancement, high competition and a flooded market, an organization cannot take the risk of investing time in the training of its resources. Older professionals are habituated to and comfortable in their own style of work which is hard to change. On the other hand, young professionals are fresh hence they can be moulded to fit any style of working. For example, when the internet started ruling over the world, older workers found it very hard to adapt to this sudden change in the workplace. Hence, organizations quickly started taking young professionals who can easily work on computers. Overall, experience does have an advantage, but this fast-paced market needs young people who are more adaptive and flexible. In conclusion, this essay argued that in current market dynamics, an organization needs employees who are flexible and responsive to change; hence, young professionals are preferred over older workers. Having said that, it is still important to retain at least some senior employees in key decision making roles. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Advertisements are an effective tool for creating public awareness about various social and other causes. Recently, we can see an increase in the number of ads promoting philanthropic institutions on television and the internet. This is mainly because such campaigns are a huge success as they enable people to easily and directly donate to them through various online payment applications. In my opinion, this is a favourable development that benefits all.  To begin with, more and more charitable organisations are showing their ads on visual and digital platforms like TV and social media. On the internet, for example, these ads can directly target people who may have helped similar charities in the past. This improves the chances of them interacting with these ads and donating. Also, donating money to a cause advertised on the internet is a hassle-free procedure and requires only a few clicks on the screen. Another advantage of donating money via such platforms is that the donor can verify the whereabouts of the beneficiary. For example, the crowdfunding platform Ketto enables people to raise funds for any cause. Verifying the credibility of such fundraising campaigns is pretty easy and hence a lot of people willingly donate. Later on, it is even possible to check how the donation helped the beneficiary. This transparency and the satisfaction that comes from helping people who need it desperately are the main reasons that make such campaigns successful. In my opinion, this is a positive development because it enables the poor and the destitute to receive help when they need it the most. Such campaigns directly connect people needing help with those willing to donate eliminating the presence of a middleman. For example, the other day, I came across a campaign for helping the stray dogs on my Instagram feed. Since I have always loved animals, I donated some money without any hesitation. Without these campaigns, it would be very difficult for me to search for and find such organizations working for the welfare of stray animals. Another advantage of these commercials is that they are helping authentic charities raise money and do phenomenal work for the upliftment of the society. Without such campaigns they may not be able to sustain themselves for long.  In conclusion, advertisements for charities have increased because more people are willing to donate for worthy causes. In my opinion, this is a positive development because such campaigns make those organizations visible to a large audience and help them get more work done for the society.",9,True,79.34338085539714,418
"It is argued by some that with the development of the internet, public libraries are not required any longer. This essay totally agrees with this statement and believes that the availability of information on online websites and access to ebooks has eliminated the need to have public libraries. The primary reason why the internet is preferred to libraries is the huge amount of information available online. This is to say that almost everyone around the world can access any type of data / information and acquire knowledge. Many educational websites and blogs are available on the internet, and the information is related to not only subjects like maths, science, history, and computer programming languages but also other major courses. For example, research by The Guardian revealed that 92% of computer science students at the University of Texas used an online site “Udemy” to learn coding languages like Java and Python language. The availability of ebooks on the internet and websites is eliminating the need for libraries. This is because when ebooks were not available in the past, many people used to visit libraries to gather and read information related to research, assignment, and projects, but ebooks have made it more convenient and easy for people to complete their research projects from the comfort of their homes without visiting the library. For instance, a survey conducted by the New York Times revealed that more than 97% of master’s students in the University of Pennsylvania used ebooks to complete their thesis projects instead of going to the library. In conclusion, this essay agrees with the argument that the advancement of the internet eliminated the need for libraries; people can acquire any kind of information to complete their research assignments and projects through educational websites and ebooks.

"Although it is a widely known fact that tens of thousands of people die of starvation, many people still waste food. Perhaps offers on food ordering app deceit customers to order more, but right initiatives from the government in collaboration with non-governmental organizations can curtail this to larger extent. Predominantly there are two main reasons for this wastage. Firstly, tempting discounts on online food ordering lure many individuals to order more than what is required. These restaurants post visually appealing images to attract customers and these food delivery apps deliver food to door-steps at the click of a button. Secondly, there is a dramatic increase in the number of big fat weddings organized by celebrities and rich people wherein they show off their wealth by serving exotic dishes that cater to the taste of every guest. Eventually these extravagant celebrations lead to excess amount of food. However, these issues can be resolved by taking simple and cognitive decisions such as having alliance with orphanages, shelter homes and party halls. Thus the excess food can be used to serve the underprivileged and does not end up in trash bins. By this way even death due to hunger and malnutrition can be decreased significantly. Another solution is to sensitize people about the plight of starving children. When people realize that the food that they waste could be used to feed needy children, they will automatically want to find a way to avoid its wastage. To conclude, big fat weddings and other celebrations that lead to the cooking of more food than necessary is the main cause of food wastage. However, by sensitizing people about the need to donate food and encouraging party organizers to collaborate with charitable organizations excess food can be used to feed the poor and the needy.

"Children often misbehave and when they do that many parents smack them to teach them a ‘lesson’. In my opinion, this behaviour is completely unacceptable. Smacking traumatises children and may even lead to more behavioural problems. There are many reasons why parents feel that smacking is the best form of discipline. To begin with, many of them are under the wrong impression that children will get the point if they are smacked for bad behaviour. This, according to some parents, will discourage them from repeating the bad behaviour. Some parents also want to have absolute control over their children and often resort to this barbaric practice to show them who is in charge of the household. Unfortunately, smacking does not help with the behavioural issues in children. In fact, it makes their problems worse. Studies have shown that children who grow up in households where they are regularly subjected to smacking and other forms of physical violence are more likely to grow into rebellious teenagers. They start to detest their elders and may also develop a hatred for authority. Of course, when parents spank their children, this is not the end result they are hoping to achieve. Having said that, it is important to discipline children. Behavioural problems need to be dealt with but instead of resorting to physical violence parents should set an example for their children. Children learn a lot by watching and imitating adults. If parents behave appropriately at all times, children will consciously or unconsciously copy their behaviour and that will solve the issue. To conclude, children are our future and we must raise them with love, patience and tolerance. Good parenting and physical violence cannot co-exist. Therefore, in my opinion, smacking children must be forbidden and parents who still resort to this practice must be severely punished by the law.",9,True,81.73141378768952,305
"It is of paramount importance for our human bodies to get their daily dose of relaxation and rejuvenation. While some people find it more relaxing to spend their leisure time by doing brain exercise, I would agree with those who prefer doing physical activities. On the one hand, some people prefer to spend their leisure time by doing intellectual activities such as solving sudoku puzzles or chess. Such activities are suitable for people who have laborious jobs that deplete their energy. After getting home, they will certainly not want to go for a run or hit the gym. Playing chess or solving crossword puzzles not only stimulate their intellect but also provide some relaxation. Another advantage of these activities is that they can be performed at home and at time. You don’t have to get out. This makes such activities suitable for climates. On the other side, other people choose to work out in the gym or run in the neighbourhood to relax. Doing such activities would help us combat our unhealthy lifestyle habits. For example, studies show that running for an hour every day helps in relieving stress and reduces Cholesterol levels which, in turn, improves our fitness and health. Moreover, getting engaged in a physical activity helps you focus on your exercise and forget anything else related to work or life concerns. This is because such activities are done in groups or outdoors and this reduces the possible distractions. Personally, I believe that intellectual leisure activities are more suitable for people whose jobs are physically demanding. Those who have a desk job should certainly flex their muscles during the free time. This is essential for their physical and emotional health.",8,True,98.61574074074073,282
"Some people believe that if senior citizens increase their social interaction and keep themselves physically active they can lead a healthy and happy life but most of them do not do so. This essay will try to identify the reasons behind this and offer some possible resolutions for the same. There can be several causes behind this trend. First, many seniors live alone. Their children have migrated to cities in search of better employment. Consequently, they are alone most of the time. While going out and talking to neighbours is still possible, many elderly people choose to stay within the confines of their home. This could be due to the nagging aches and pains that afflict everyone as they age. Unfortunately, when they do not move about much, their health deteriorates even further. There are also some seniors who believe that they have discharged all of their duties and there is nothing more for them to do. They also tend to live a life of inactivity and seclusion.  There can be some possible solutions to this issue. Governments and private organizations should offer jobs to senior citizens. This benefits them as well as the organization because they can stay mentally and socially occupied while putting their extensive experience and expertise to good use. Seniors are experienced people. There should be avenues for them to use their knowledge and experience for the benefit of them. For example, they can engage in community work. Also, the older people should indulge more in hobbies they find interesting. Gardening for instance, can keep a person on his toes and physically fit. Furthermore, the older generation people can join local clubs with their peers and friends to reduce loneliness. To conclude, older people lead a sedentary and isolated lifestyle mainly due to age related ailments that restrict their movement. They can solve these problems to a great extent by getting involved in community work and pursuing a hobby.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.",8,True,90.3960979687194,338
"When it comes to animal testing, there is a growing debate over whether researchers should conduct research at the expense of animals for human benefits. While some people assert that it is ethically wrong and unacceptable, I believe that their sacrifice should be continued in order to create a better and healthier world. There are many animal lovers who assert that researchers / scientists should stop using live creatures for experimentation as they believe it is morally wrong and cruel and people have no right to exploit other organisms for their benefits. Aside from that, they opine that there are some alternative ways to replace those animal subjects in tests. For example, a computer program which shows the suitability of a new drug on the human immune system can be used for medical research. This way, animals would no longer suffer from medical experimentations and people would still be able to benefit from the medical advancements. Nevertheless, the contribution animals have made to the medical improvement is significant, and as yet there is no alternative method that can provide the same result as animals do in medical research. Although some computer programs are being used to conduct clinical trials their results often fail when the drug is administered on humans. Moreover, while people derive benefits from animal experimentations, other forms of wild life also benefit from the test results as those animals may also suffer from the similar diseases that people experience such as Cancer and Asthma. In conclusion, there are convincing arguments both for and against animal tests. Although exploiting those animal lives seems cruel, their sacrifice is essential for the long-term survival of human and other live organisms. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is impossible to gain certain personal traits through tertiary education. I certainly agree with this statement because certain attributes can only be learnt through practical experience and these days universities tend to focus more on securing a job for students rather than developing their personality. Certain personal qualities like leadership skills cannot be mastered through university education. It can only be acquired through practical experience. Universities do teach leadership skills; however, there is not much emphasis on this. For example, in some universities there are dedicated sessions to train students on soft skills; however, these skills are not practiced so they wear out in a short span of time. Colleges provide students with theoretical knowledge about leadership, whereas a real time experience would give them a comprehensive understanding of the skill. Universities focus on securing a job for a student rather than developing their personality traits. Job placements are considered to be of paramount importance for students, which is why the emphasis is high on them. As a matter of fact, students choose universities that have excellent placement records. So, institutions tend to focus on developing their technical knowledge rather than personal qualities. For instance, the information technology industry is known to hire more candidates than any other industry and it requires students to have a strong programming background rather than strong personal skills. By contrast, if companies had given equal importance to technical and soft skills, colleges would have trained students accordingly. To recapitulate, I believe that it is not easy to achieve certain personal traits through tertiary education because qualities such as leadership skills can only be mastered through practical experience and universities tend to focus more on job placements than soft skills.

"Unconventional tourism or visiting inaccessible places has lately become quite an attraction for travelers across the globe. The number of tourists visiting places such as Mount Everest, Antarctica and Sahara desert has sky rocketed over the past few years. In the next set of paragraphs, I will outline both the advantages and drawbacks of this trend. First of all, there is an increased awareness of these unconventional locations due to the rise of social media. This is an advantage because more and more people are being made aware of how beautiful our planet is. Also, owing to their inhospitable conditions, these kinds of places come across as challenges that need to be conquered. Hence the gritty and adventurous folks get excited about taming them. As more and more people explore these places, the society at large will be able to appreciate the previously unseen beauty that was hiding from plain sight. However, there is a disadvantage as well. Human settlements in these remote and beautiful places mean that a pile of garbage will be left behind by tourists. For instance, consider the case of Mount Everest. In the 20th century scaling Mount Everest was a rarity. Now, with increased use of technology more and more people are able to scale it and experience the best that nature has to offer. However, these hikers camping on the Everest have left behind huge piles of waste on the world’s largest peak. This has become such a big problem that Nepal’s tourism authority has been forced to jump into action to clean the plastic and other forms of waste. In conclusion, visiting remote places comes with both advantages and disadvantages. More and more remote parts of the world are documented for all of us to see and experience the diversity that planet earth has to offer. However, by trying to tame these places we are destroying the very natural beauty that these places have to offer. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Nowadays, many countries are promoting bicycle usage by spending a huge amount of money on it. There are several reasons for this strategy. For example, bicycles are environment friendly and help in maintaining good health.  It is also considered as a useful solution for the traffic congestion. There are many reasons why some governments choose to promote bicycle usage. One of the main advantages is that the bicycle is eco-friendly. In other words, no fuel is needed to run the bicycle as it is operated manually or electrically. Hence, it drastically reduces air pollution caused by automobiles. Furthermore, the maintenance cost is almost negligible. Therefore, government spending on bicycle usage is a nice strategy to combat pollution caused by automobiles. Promoting the bicycle usage is one of the best solutions to the traffic congestion. For example, in the cities like Montreal, there are bicycle stands where bicycles can be parked and rented for use for a minimal price. Also, every road has separate lanes for the bicycle riding that occupy comparatively very less space than other vehicles. To illustrate, four bicycles can pass simultaneously in the amount of space used by a car. So, it aids in dealing with traffic-congested roads and is time saving. Moreover, the number of causalities due to traffic congestion comes down to minimal. In conclusion, more countries should take initiatives to adopt this method as it helps in solving traffic problems and benefits the environment. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Today’s world requires faster connectivity. For sustainable economic growth it is the need of the hour that people and business can connect without any delay. The aviation industry has realized the need and reduced the rates of the flights that they operate. Obviously this has helped many people but critics also see a few pitfalls in this trend. Globalization has brought countries closer. Businesses in one country are getting merged or acquired by businesses in other countries at increasing rates than before. Students from one country are studying in other countries. Cheaper flights are really proving to be a boon in such scenarios. It helps businesses and supports rapid economic growth. Along with this the aviation industry is also on a high growth trajectory. However the advantages of cheaper flight come with some disadvantages too. With cheaper flights traditional transport modes will lose their sheen. A big section of the society derives their employment from industries associated with traditional mode of transports. In country such as India, Indian Railways is the second largest public sector employer. If people use railways less and less, serious questions arise on the future of these people. Secondly, it is also important to note that the world is facing increased terrorist activities and in recent years we have observed many attempts to sabotage flights. Increasing use of airways, expose us to such risks too. Considering all the pros and cons of the situation, I am of the opinion that we should continue with the trend. Government and authorities should encourage the aviation industries to reduce the flight rates further. At the same time risks associated with security and employment should be dealt with strategic intent. Governments can declare some sops for the traditional modes of transport and help them become more competitive. People associated with them can be trained to work in other industries.

"It is argued that education is a crucial part of every individual’s life, so every student should get it for free. I agree with this statement because many intelligent students discontinue their education after high school because they cannot afford fees and it is the responsibility of colleges and universities to ensure that every student of their country get education without any problem. Every student should have free access to university studies because it is their right. Free education will help students to study well without worrying about financial problems. Many students who are serious about studies belong to poor families because they are determined to improve their financial circumstances in future. To illustrate, several universities in India offer graduate and post graduate degrees free of cost to meritorious students who pass the entrance test. This is because their target is to educate the hard working and intelligent students. It is also the responsibility of the university to ensure that bright students can study further free of cost and improve their circumstances.  In simple words, if the students get admission in colleges after high school he/she will be able to get the job of their dreams. Consequently, they can help their families and the nation strongly because of the knowledge they gained at college in certain areas such as science, technology, medical or business. For instance, in Germany any student can join college in any field of their interest without fee and this helps German people to develop their career without any stress.

"It is true that the number of people having a car has increased exponentially in the last  thirty years. While I completely agree with the view / opinion / argument that most metro cities have become ‘one big traffic jam’, there are many steps which governments can take to tackle this problem. Traffic congestion is the most pressing issue that many cities across the world face today. Over the last few decades, the rate of car ownership has accelerated significantly, and if not controlled, it is likely to rise further. Admittedly, governments across the world have tried to resolve / fix this problem by widening existing roads; however, they have not been able to match the pace of increasing car ownership. Consequently, the problem of congestion has escalated to such a level that in big cities, it affects not only business activities but also the physical and mental well-being of residents. Businesses incur loss because of the delay in moving their goods and manpower. Urban residents also suffer because of the constant noise and air pollution caused by frequent traffic jams. There are many measures that governments can initiate to contain this issue of increasing number of cars on roads. First of all, governments can increase the financial burden of owing a car by imposing green tax on the sale of new cars and fuel. They are likely to face resistance from voters; however, they can certainly gather public support by running awareness campaigns. Moreover, they can invest more in public transport. If people find that travelling by bus or commuter train can save their money and time, they will certainly prefer them to private vehicles. In conclusion, although most cities struggle with the issue of traffic congestion, authorities can alleviate this situation / problem by imposing carbon tax on private vehicles and improving public transport infrastructure.",9,True,101.31911532385466,303

"Band 9 essay sample Lack of education and employment opportunities are the main causes of the rising crime rate. Some people, therefore, feel that by simply educating prisoners, we can discourage them from committing crimes again after they get released from prison. I totally agree with this view. Almost nobody is born a criminal. Most criminals are victims of circumstances. In fact most of them come from the poor strata of the society and lack education. As a result they don’t have many employment opportunities. Many of them eventually become thieves or gangsters. By contrast, criminal tendencies are comparatively low among educated people. Educating convicted criminals in prison will certainly not erase their shoddy past. However, it improves their chances of finding employment once they get released. One of the biggest problems that ex-prisoners face is the lack of rehabilitation opportunities. The society prefers to keep them at an arm’s length and as such they have fewer opportunities for making a living once they complete their sentence. Unfortunately, this increases their chances of getting into crime again. Education may change the situation for good. If prisoners receive an opportunity to learn and acquire vocational or academic degrees from prison, they are more likely to find employment upon their release. When they have a secure job and a means of living, most people will not want to get into crime again. To conclude, education improves a person’s employability. Just because someone is a prisoner, it does not mean that they cannot learn or acquire degrees. In fact, educating prisoners is one of the best things we can do for their rehabilitation and successful induction into the society.  ",9,True,102.74344151427101,275
"Note that all band score estimates are approximate. It is undoubtedly true that nowadays a proper curriculum planning has become a vital part of education. Many people feel that it is important for the students to be taught drawing in school. In my personal opinion, I feel that a student’s time can be utilized much more effectively than wasting on learning arts. On the one hand, drawing or painting helps to enhance the creativity in children. This in turn helps them to build their imagination and can also broaden their horizon or way of thinking. It helps them to become better individuals in life. Also, being engaged in such an activity helps students to relax by breaking the monotonous job of studying academics. On the other hand, there are certain circumstances wherein the idea of including art in curriculum will not be welcomed by many pupils and parents. For instance, a child who is more interested in playing sports will feel that it is a waste of time to sit and draw. Instead it would be more rewarding if he invests his time in learning or practicing sports rather than drawing. Furthermore, the basic motive of many parents to send their children to school is for studying rather than co-curricular activities and hence they would want the school to focus on academics as against drawing. Hence, I feel that it will not be a good idea to teach drawing at schools because there are many classes outside schools which can be utilized for this purpose if at all a child is interested in it. In conclusion, I feel that it should not be made mandatory by schools to teach drawing, however it can be offered as an optional subject in the curriculum. This will enable the students to make a sagacious choice depending onwhatever is best suited for them. Would you like to use our writing correction service?

In my opinion, free time should be used to energize our mind by giving it rest so that we can work efficiently. This essay will discuss both views of the topic. After fulfilling our official and personal commitments, we get very little time for ourselves to relax our body and mind. Some believe that working our mind by playing puzzle games will help to improve decision making skill so that we can carry out our daily activities quickly and with more ease. Certainly reading books and newspaper will help us to improve our concentration and observation abilities and elevate the level of our general knowledge which is an added advantage. Reading books can enrich our mind and it works as a stress buster for many of us. However, many argue that resting our mind in leisure time is more appropriate than bombarding it with different ideas which can make us feel tired. There are several ways of maintaining an active and peaceful mind such as doing yoga or meditation, taking a break from your routine and travelling to new places; visiting your family can also recharge your mind. A healthy mind represents a healthy body hence it is essential to give our mind a break from mundane routine so that it will be ready to cope up with challenges in life. In conclusion, the state of our mind reflects our ability to deal with anything that comes our way hence maintaining and enhancing our mental health is crucial for leading a successful and fulfilling life.

"These days, more and more people tend to move from smaller towns or villages to big cities, thereby raising the population in urban areas. Overpopulation of urban areas has led to many problems. This essay will highlight some serious issues and subsequently suggest a few solutions to overcome these. There are many issues caused by overpopulation. Firstly, it creates traffic congestion due to the increasing number of vehicles on roads. As a result, there are more road accidents and subsequently, more air population. For instance, according to a recent article published by the Times of India, there is a 20% rise in air pollution in Delhi. The influx of migrants from other parts of the country has also increased the cost of living in urban areas because of the increased demand for housing and other facilities. For middle class families, it is becoming difficult to survive. Thus, the growing traffic and the rising cost of living are posing a challenge for individuals as well as government.   To overcome the aforementioned issues, firstly, municipalities must focus on new infrastructure, such as widening of roads, or constructing new flyovers. It will certainly be helpful to reduce traffic to some extent. Secondly, there is an immediate need for more houses. The local government should seriously expand the housing facilities in cities to accommodate more families. Definitely, these suggestions can support to reduce congestion and living cost. To sup up, overpopulation is a major cause of concern in urban areas.  There is an immediate need to control traffic congestion by building better infrastructure. It is also important to build affordable housing.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate. ",7,True,85.81382308324018,286
"More and more undergraduate students are opting to work in their spare time. While temporary jobs offer several benefits, the drawbacks of this cannot be ignored. This essay will outline the positives as well as negatives of this approach.  On the one hand, there are numerous benefits to taking a part time job. Firstly, it helps the student to become independent so that they do not have to ask for pocket-money whenever they are in financial need. Secondly, taking half-time work fosters / bolsters their future career prospects as most of the employers prefer employees who have some work experience. In a recent report by Employment Exchange in India, more than 80% of 1000 job seekers got their desired job because they had experience in the domain. On the other hand, a part time job can be distractive because students cannot concentrate on their studies while working part-time. In addition to that, young students have no money management skills and hence they may end up spending their hard-earned money on useless things. For example, according to a survey conducted by Reliance Trends Store, most of the sales come from teenagers who have just started earning.  In conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to pursuing a part time job. It makes youngsters financially independent and enables them to gain valuable work experience.

"Computer technologies have developed at an unprecedented pace nowadays, and some argue that it is pointless to support / maintain public libraries because their functions are increasingly being fulfilled by computers. In my view, while using laptops can make research easier and more interesting, state libraries are worth investing in / worth the investment because of the important role they play in this modern world.  It is true that computers can sometimes do a better job than the traditional library in dispensing information and engaging learners. Through the internet, people can access information in a variety of means such as through online newspaper, blogs, or video clips, and the way to do so can be as straightforward as a single click on the mouse. Furthermore, compared to reading printed text/books/magazines which might seem comparatively boring, it is more intriguing and engaging for most people to surf the internet and watch programs such as BBC online documentaries to acquire the knowledge they need.  However, despite these benefits brought by computers, I believe that libraries still occupy an irreplaceable place in people’s lives. Firstly, as all the books and magazines in the library are published by professional houses, their reliability and authoritativeness is guaranteed. It therefore reduces the possibility of people getting misguided by false information. In addition, public libraries generally have sufficient budget provided by the government so that they can invite experts to give lectures. This approach allows visitors to gain deep insights into a certain specialized field, which can hardly be achieved by merely using a computer on one’s own.  In conclusion, computer technology has made information research more accessible and enjoyable, but I believe that state-funded libraries are still of great value for citizens to obtain reliable and quality content. Consequently, they deserve to continue to exist and to receive a stable subsidy from the authority. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Nowadays, it is hard to find a home that does not have a television set. People irrespective of their age, educational or social background spend a lot of time watching TV. Some people argue that watching television for hours on end can make people lazy and unsociable. I agree with this view to a great extent.  People who spend a lot of time watching TV are called couch potatoes. That is because they rarely get out of that couch. Unfortunately, this habit makes them lazy and physically inactive. Also, when people sit in front of their TV all day long, they do not have time to go out and meet other people. Eventually, this affects their social skills and makes them introverts. These days, in many families it is common for both children and adults to have their meals sitting in front of the television. They rarely take their eyes off the television or talk to other members of the family as they finish the meal without even looking at the plate. This habit hurts relations within the family as well. Also, it leads to binge eating and thus make people obese further limiting their activity levels.  Even so, it is wrong to assume that everyone who watches TV will turn into a couch potato. Most of the times, this depends on the kind of programmes they watch on television. For example, people who watch a lot of sports shows or fitness programmes on TV may as well hit the gym or play competitive sport. Likewise, people who watch programmes about traveling are more likely to pack their bag and go on trips frequently. In conclusion, it is true that spending a lot of time watching TV can make people lazy and discourage them from socializing with others; however, there are also many television channels that encourage people to live an active life.

"Many parents insist that the access to electronic media for children should be restricted and they should be encouraged to read books in their free time. I completely agree with this proposition and in this essay, I will explain the demerits of spending an excessive amount of time on electronic gadgets and the merits of book reading.   To start with, when children spend an excessive amount of time watching television or playing computer games, it has a negative impact on their health and psychology. First and foremost, it weakens the eye-sight of children. The reason is the blue rays which come out of all the electronic devices and if kids watch such devices for a very long time, it will affect their eye-sight. Furthermore, some cartoon shows on TV and video games make children more aggressive and ill-mannered. For instance, playing games on Xbox that involve fighting can influence children to be violent in real life. Similarly, some cartoon shows can teach them improper language. Therefore, parents must limit the kids’ screen time.   Instead of engaging children on electronic devices, elders should persuade them to read books as it has numerous benefits. Firstly, the book reading habit would improve language skills. When someone starts reading, he or she will come across vast vocabulary and get to learn proper grammar. This way the command over language strengthens. Simultaneously, the knowledge of different subjects increases when the child reads more. More significantly, reading books will enhance the imaginative capabilities of a child. The reason behind this is that in books, the situations of the story are described in words and to understand that a reader has to imagine the background and this mental exercise improves their creativity.   In conclusion, the advice to cut down children’s screen time and replace it by book reading time is reasonable because too much access to electronic media will harm children’s eyesight as well as inculcate bad habits in them. However, motivating them towards book reading will not only improve their knowledge and language but will also develop their imagination power. ",8,True,91.32783615721678,344
"Skills such as reading, writing and math have always been considered important. With the invention of computers, some people are of the view that computer skills should also form part of the education system. I firmly believe that computer skills should be a compulsory part of the curriculum because people can get better jobs and solve complex problems with the help of computers. Firstly, computer skills should be compulsorily taught in the schools and colleges because companies are looking for candidates who have at least basic knowledge in the field of computer. This is because people who do not possess the requisite skills in the area of computers are not efficient. In other words, they will find a lot of adversities in getting a decent job. For example, a leading job portal reports that 95% of companies are looking for candidates who are well versed in computer skills. Thus, I completely believe that introducing this skill will eventually help the prospective job candidates to tackle the competition in their workplace. Secondly, computers can solve complex problems that arise in the workplace with the help of artificial intelligence. Computers have brought about a paradigm shift in the way work is now being performed. Despite the fact that some sort of human intervention is required, most of the jobs in any domain can be performed efficiently with computers. For instance, a survey conducted by the Christ University revealed / found that most of the complex problems at the workplace could be solved with the help of computers using artificial intelligence.

"These days most people want to get their work done almost instantly. They don’t have the time or patience to wait. Right now, right here is the motto. I attribute this change in attitude to the development in technology, especially internet and mobile technology and, in my opinion, it can be positive and negative at the same time. No other technology has had a greater impact on our lives than the internet technology. To say that the internet revolutionized our lives is an understatement. It has made it possible for us to perform just about anything with a few clicks of a button. It allows us to book tickets online, buy things and pay bills anytime and from anywhere. Gone are the days when we had to stand in a long queue to buy railway tickets or pay utility bills. All of those mundane tasks can now be performed within a few seconds. The biggest advantage of the internet is that we can carry it around because it works on a variety of devices of all sizes and shapes. Obviously, it is quite normal for a generation that grew up using the internet from their childhood to want to get everything done in seconds. However, this insistence on getting instant support or response can be positive or negative depending upon our access to technology. The internet has certainly made our lives comfortable and faster. It has allowed us to save a lot time. However, like any other technology, the internet technology can also fail us from time to time. Connection speeds vary from place to place. Also, the reliability is not the same throughout the day. It is not uncommon for people addicted to instant gratification to panic when they lose connectivity. This is a common problem when city people visit rural areas where the internet is either slow or inaccessible.

"Advancements in communication technology have made the entire world a global village where information travels from one corner to another in the blink of an eye. Due to this information symmetry and accessibility, the world is becoming increasingly similar. Some people argue that this is a negative development. While I do not quite consider this as totally negative, in my opinion, there is definitely a need to preserve diversity. The first and foremost reason to oppose the tendency of countries to become similar is that it will lead to the loss of indigenous culture, traditions, customs and lifestyles. These lifestyles and culture were developed several millennia ago and suit the specific country. So, adopting another country’s lifestyles and culture might not be suitable for people living in that country. For example, in a country like India, it is better to eat vegetarian food and wear cotton clothes because the climate is hot. Furthermore, it is unsustainable if people living everywhere follow the same lifestyle. For example, the per capita consumption of fossil fuels in the USA is 20 times higher than the per capita consumption of the same fuel in a developing country. If people everywhere start using the same amount of energy, we will soon run out of its supply. Another reason for nurturing diversity is that diversity enhances innovation. Different culture and lifestyles provide one a different perspective on life. Thus, many schools and colleges prefer to increase diversity in their classroom to enrich the learning experience.  In the past, many pharmaceutical research teams in the USA attributed their success to essential inputs brought in by teammates of different nationality.  On the other hand, by adopting similarity, one can protect oneself from discrimination based on race, nationality or style of clothing. In addition, similarity enhances acceptance. It also makes life easier especially when people travel abroad.  In conclusion, considering the aforementioned views, in my opinion, it is crucial to protect diversity of different countries but at the same time there is no harm in imbibing the best practices of other countries.

"Exercise is the key to health as per eminent doctors. Despite this, older generations shun from exercising. I believe the reason behind this is the fear of injury and by alleviating that they can be motivated to perform exercise. Older people abstain from doing exercise due to fear of injury. It is a well-known fact that during old age, the human body is weaker. If the body sustains any injury, recovery could take months or years.

To cite an example from my personal experience, my grandmother’s ankle got twisted during evening walk; therefore, she had to use wheelchair for 2 months and took another one month in order to walk properly.

The family can play a crucial role in helping them achieve this.

"A growing number of people in developing nations are buying their own vehicles for the first time. While this is a sign of affluence, it can have a negative impact on the environment. The main issue associated with the increasing numbers of vehicles is high levels of carbon dioxide emission. Since developing countries have significantly higher population than developed countries, when more people drive cars there the result is a harmful increase in air pollution. Needless to say, there is a dramatic increase in the incidences of respiratory ailments. For example, the major cities in China are suffering from serious atmospheric contamination, and the WHO reported more than five thousand cases of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and 300 deaths in many nations in 2008. The majority of them were in China. Making public transport more reliable and cheaper is the most effective way to discourage the excessive use of private vehicles. Another long term solution to this predicament is to educate young people about the dangers of air contamination by exhaust gases from automobiles. Children in schools could be taught about how to reduce the problem. They are also likely to teach their parents about the things they learned at school and adults will also be influenced by this initiative. For instance, students in Netherlands were taught about consequences of driving their own car in a reckless manner, and now the number of drivers has declined. Furthermore, the most preferable transport for Dutch people is bicycles and using public transport or carpooling is common means to travel.

Such requirements already disqualify a large section of job hunters. Next, a few people desire to become rich in shorter-period. To illustrate this, a business can earn a person a hefty sum of money overnight as all the profit goes to the pocket of the owner.  However, there are several drawbacks to this. To start with, there is no guarantee that a self employed person will earn enough to live a comfortable life. When people work for a company, they have the assurance of a guaranteed paycheck at the end of the month; however, when they work for themselves this guarantee is missing. Another disadvantage is that many self employed people work day and night and do not get time to spend with their family and friends. Thus, it creates an imbalance in their work and personal life. Moreover, a huge difference can be seen in their daily routine which affects their health adversely.  To recapitulate, working for oneself is definitely beneficial for young people because it enables them to work on their own terms; however, there are drawbacks such as the lack of a guaranteed paycheck that need to be considered before choosing to be an entrepreneur.

"There are contradictory thoughts and beliefs regarding subjects that students should learn at university. One set of people believe that students should study the subject of their choice while others believe that students should study only subjects like science and technology which will be beneficial for them in future. This essay will discuss why students should choose a subject that suits their inclination rather than studying a few popular subjects.  There are enormous job opportunities in the field of science and technology and along with that they offer fancy perks and fast growth too. Considering above things some people think that rather than studying any one subject, students should study only those subjects which have high demand and employment opportunities. For example, in the year 2017, 56 multi-national companies started their operations in different locations in India and then hired 900 software engineers on handsome salary. There is no doubt that these subjects have huge importance but other subjects are also valuable. Students give best results when they are free to study whatever they like. It is disastrous to force students to study only a few subjects without considering their interest. For example, a student can enjoy medicine only if he wants to become a doctor. If all students learn science and technology, we will only have doctors and engineers. This will lead to many problems because the world needs professionals with a variety of skills and expertise. This essay discussed why students should opt to study whatever they like rather than focus / focusing on a few subjects. In my opinion students must explore their interests to find out which field fits them the best.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Today, technology has an impact on every aspect of our lives. A group of people feel that advances in technology like smart phones and their applications are making people sociable while others feel they are not. The paragraphs below shall discuss both sides of the arguments and give my personal opinion. Generally speaking these days all the humans are addicted to their phones which have various free applications like Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, Whatsapp and so on. These apps have made communication very easy because people can pass messages, pictures, documents and drafts to one another in a fraction of a second. People can pass messages, pictures, documents, drafts,etc. to one another in a fraction of a second. As a result, people build new friendships and maintain them by sending messages or doing voice calls often. Although technology is enhancing communication, it has some negative effects. First of all, the face to face communication has drastically reduced. As a result, the bonding among family members is reducing. Actually, technology is building fake relations. For instance, most of the youngsters these days are hooked on to their phone and avoid talking personally or going and meeting family members. This in fact reduces the need to meet people and is making people less social. To conclude, I personally feel that advances in technology have helped us in many ways but they have a detrimental effect on communication especially among family members. It would be better if people avoid using gadgets when they are with family, especially on occasions like lunch or parties at home. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Band 9 essay sample Governments all over the world are grappling with problems like rising unemployment and growing threats of terrorism. Poverty is still a major issue in many countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa. In such a scenario, the argument that the government should stop wasting money on arts might sound logical. However, in my opinion, arts do have a place in the society. While I don’t think that the government should waste a lot of money on arts, it should at least adopt a benevolent attitude towards arts and artists. Contrary to popular belief, arts are not a waste of time. In fact, they are also an industry with great potential to generate money. Performance arts, for instance, enjoy considerable following. A music concert or a dance show featuring an accomplished singer or dancer can create a lot of jobs. Arts can also help sell a country as a tourist destination. For example, the Indian government actively uses traditional arts forms to promote tourism in the country. India’s classical dance forms like Bharatanatyam and Kathakali have enthralled audience all over of the world and attract thousands of international tourists to the nation. The influx of tourists creates jobs and helps the local economy. Paintings and sculptures also have huge commercial value. Millions of people visit museums in Spain, Italy and Holland to admire the works of masters like Vincent Van Gog, Picasso and Salvador Daly. While these artists are no longer around, their timeless works are still earning a lot of money for their countries. Nations that promote their ethic arts and crafts also tend to enjoy good reputation overseas. To conclude, while it is true that spending money on imparting education and building infrastructure is more important than promoting arts, in my opinion, the government should still do whatever it can to promote and sustain arts. Art forms, especially those that have a huge following, benefit the national economy in many ways.",8,True,86.48389570552146,325
"It is now some time since the whole world was involved in one war. The world nowadays is no comparison to the past, when millions of soldiers were lost on the battlefield. As the world today is significantly safer than previously, it can be argued that governments should stop spending large amounts of money on their military forces.The last World War dates back nearly seventy years and, since 1945, no conflict has taken place in western countries. Thus, people have suggested that spending money on necessities within society instead of armed forces is more useful. However, this is very difficult, as even though no significant conflict has taken place in western countries, they are still involved in the conflicts of other countries. For example, the US contribution in the Iraqi war has only recently ended. For such involvement of military forces in foreign lands, countries still need to have strong armed forces, in case they are needed.In some countries like the UK, the military is already significantly weaker than it has been in the past. However, historically, a hundred years is not that long and because no conflict has happened recently, this does not mean that there will be no conflict in the future. At the outbreak of World War Two, the UK was seriously under-prepared, as it had been thought that the horrors of World War One had convinced everyone of the uselessness of war.In conclusion, certain armed forces are necessary for major countries even though the world is safer than a hundred years ago. They might need to intervene in conflicts in other countries and world peace is by no means assured for the future.",9,True,71.0995260663507,276
"According to some people building sky trains is a better way to solve traffic problems in cities than building ground railways or underground tubes. In this essay I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of sky trains in terms of their ability to ease traffic congestion. On the one hand, there are numerous benefits to operating sky trains. To start with, overheard railways occupy minimal land. They do not require much land space apart from the land required for constructing pillars and tube stations. Hence, they leave enough space for other forms of ground transport and eventually reduce traffic congestion.   A perfect example of this is seen in the Indian capital New Delhi, where the recent construction of overhead tubes helped diminish road traffic. Secondly, this mode of conveyance is much faster than other forms of transport. Overhead tubes will take significantly less time than cars or ground trains to reach one destination from another. Thus, they save commuting time and at the same time reduce traffic.  On the other hand, there are a few drawbacks to sky trains which cannot be overlooked.  One evident disadvantage is the humungous cost it takes to construct overhead tubes. A major portion of any government’s budget goes into the making of overhead network of trains. Because of these financial constraints, sky trains are not in the priority list of most governments. Safety is another concern. Since the tubes move on narrow concrete paths, it is considered an extremely unsafe mode of conveyance. In addition to these risk factors, emergency evacuation is not always possible in the event of a mishap. In conclusion, sky trains are certainly more effective than surface or underground trains in easing traffic congestion in cities; however, their downsides cannot be overlooked.

"It is commonly believed by a significant number of people that foreign tourists have a negative impact on their countries. There are several reasons for this negative attitude towards international travellers. This essay will first highlight price inflation and influence on local culture as the root causes of the aforementioned issue and then it will discuss certain measures that could be taken to handle the situation.  To begin with, international tourism adversely affects the prices of basic goods and services in an economy. Needless to say, whether it is for a business or leisure purpose, foreign visitors tend to spend a significant amount of money during their visit, and such transactions occur in foreign currencies which are higher in value when compared to the local currency. As a result, the local service providers charge higher for their goods and services. While this price inflation barely affects the foreigner, it hurts the local resident. For instance, according to some estimates, local food and lodging costs in Thailand increased dramatically in the last three decades. The same problem exists in almost all tourist places.  Similarly, multi-cultural visitors from different countries impact the local culture negatively. Foreign travellers tend to show disrespect towards traditional customs of the host country. As an illustration, in Malaysia, tourists consume alcohol in public and wear certain clothes which expose their bodies; consequently, local people get influenced and adopt similar practices. If tourists had respected norms and traditions of the host society, local values would not have been affected negatively.  However, aforementioned issues may be resolved by adopting certain proactive measures. Firstly, governments should design certain policies to control the price of local services regardless of foreign visitor’s spending. Likewise, airport management, in collaboration with local authorities, should run cultural awareness campaigns for non-native visitors. To conclude, the inhospitable perception that the local people have of the international tourists can be explained in many ways. In my opinion, it is essential for the governments of hosting countries to change such negative attitude by controlling price hikes and making overseas visitors aware of local values.

"Even though modern medicine has increased the life expectancy in general, the overall quality of life has taken a plunge due to health problems caused by the modern lifestyle. While some recommend a complete go back to traditional medicine, may others including me recommend a combination of traditional and modern medicines to adequately address the situation because traditional medicines were designed at a time that did not take the modern lifestyle into account.  As technology advanced and demand for goods increased, machines started performing many of the common tasks that humans used to perform because machines are more efficient in performing mundane tasks. As a result, the daily physical activity of humans has significantly decreased; for example, motor cars have eliminated the need to walk or cycle. Furthermore, as population increased the demand for food and supplies has increased with it. To meet that new demand, companies are producing genetically modified crops that yield a higher output but can cause diseases such as cancer. Although traditional medicines are very effective in treating both common and complex health conditions, they are not designed to manage issues caused by the lack of physical activity or the consumption of unhealthy foods.  Modern medicine has been making tremendous progress in managing life style problems such as obesity and cancer. However, there are a lot of known and unknown side effects to them because they have not been in the market for long. Traditional medicines on the other hand are devoid of such side effects and can treat a lot of issues that people face today. In addition, since modern medicine has assumed prominence today, traditional medicine is ignored to a great extent and does not receive enough funding. Therefore, traditional medicine is not catching up in some of the areas where modern medicine is doing wonders.  In conclusion, modern lifestyle has created medical problems that were absent in the past when humans consumed more natural produce and exercised more. As a result, traditional medicine that was created without taking the modern lifestyle into account cannot solve all the medical problems of the day even though it offers effective cures to many illnesses. Modern medicine, on the other hand, received significant research attention in the last century and has made strides in curing many diseases caused by lifestyle. Therefore, I recommend a combination of both traditional and modern medicines to create a harmonious balance.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Nowadays it is essential to have the right mix of both youngsters and seniors within an organization. According to some people, young workers make a greater contribution to the bottom line of the company; however, others insist that seniors contribute more. In my opinion, both of them are crucial for the success of a company.  In this fast-paced business environment many companies are investing heavily on young professionals. One of the pivotal reasons for this phenomenon is that an organization needs fresh ideas and innovations to have a dominant position in the market. Another reason for recruiting more young people could be the latest technology deployed across the departments. Young people are better than seniors at using technology. For instance, according to data released by CII in the year 2018, the most profitable and innovative companies in India also have the youngest percentage of young people working for them. In other words, to drive innovation and profitability, an organisation needs a younger workforce.  On the other hand, the contribution of old and experienced employees cannot be ignored. This is because their experience and exposure to different business situations make them better at handling stressful situations. In addition to that, experienced employees can make calculated moves and invest in avenues that will give steady and sustainable profits. For example, as per CII the companies which have showed balanced growth over the last 5 years are the ones having the most experienced staff.  To recapitulate, a company needs both young and mature employees to retain their competitive advantage and stay profitable. While youngsters can bring in innovation, seniors know how to steer the organization during bad times.  ",7,True,81.65401731309018,273

"Food is now prepared with modern techniques which makes cooking convenient for people.  People can now make meals at much greater speed than before, without sweating much. Although this change has brought a lot gains, its drawbacks cannot be ignored. On the one hand, people are enjoying easy cooking. In conventional methods of cooking, wood was burned to make fire. As the burning of wood produced a lot smoke, it was very difficult for people to prepare food and they often developed a lot of respiratory problems. Additionally, the utensils used for cooking were not very well engineered. For example, there was no way to control the degree of heat emerging from the flames. Also, there were no efficient tools to hold the hot utensils; people often had to use the clothes. Now people have chimney, stoves, induction cook top etc. at their disposal which make it hassle free to cook food. On the other hand, there are some downsides to easily cooked food. These foods not only cause health problems but also make people lazy / but also develop the habit of laziness in people. Consequently, people with busy life schedules do not maintain a healthy diet and easily become addicted to these items, only to discover their harmful effects at a later date.  In conclusion, advancement of technology has led to easy preparation of foods and eliminated many problems faced in traditional methods of cooking.

"University education is the stepping stone to a successful career. Many students stay with their parents, whereas others rent a separate house or share a hostel room with their friends to study at a university. This essay will discuss the merits and demerits of both scenarios. The major advantage of staying with parents during college days is that one does not have to worry about expenditures. Many parents are rich enough to pay for their children’s college expenses and this helps the students who live with their families to concentrate on their studies. However, this makes children overly dependent on their parents and puts them in trouble when they have move to another city for work. For example, a survey conducted by Harvard University reveals that 76% of students who stayed in their hometown for higher studies struggle to prepare their own meal when they move to another city for work. On the flip side, travelling to a different city for higher studies teaches the student valuable life lessons. When a student starts living alone, he learns self-discipline by doing day to day activities. For instance, washing clothes, cooking meals and doing all other daily chores enables him to be independent and this is the main advantage of staying away from parents. At the same time, it is difficult for the students to cope up with all these activities along with studies. Some students even work part time to manage their own expenses. These are the downside of staying alone during higher studies.  In conclusion, students benefit in different ways when they live with their family and when they stay alone.

"The past few decades have seen a substantial decline in the living standards of individuals. More and more people are paying little / hardly any attention to health care and well-being. It is believed by a few people that the doctors should the ones responsible for spreading health awareness among their patients. I partially agree with this. I believe the combined efforts of doctors, schools and media will play a crucial role in helping people to improve their health. First and foremost, there is no denying the fact that the doctors are highly educated professionals and possess a wide range of knowledge related to physical and mental health. This is because the doctors must go through rigorous education and training for a period of six to eight years and this makes them the most qualified people to dispense health advice. The deep knowledge and high qualifications that these medical practitioners possess makes them the most trust worthy people to deliver health care advice to their patients. Furthermore, working in hospitals and clinics daily makes it easier for them to instil the imperativeness of health in their patients. However, it is also crucial for the schools along with the media to fulfill their responsibility by helping people with advice and motivation with the objective of increasing their life expectancy. Firstly, the education system should provide students with lessons which give them information about detrimental and contagious illness and how to avoid them. Thus, students are more likely to be aware of the dangers these major diseases pose to their health from an early age. Secondly the media should broadcast more mental health programs and health podcasts on national media to spread more awareness on major health problems and infectious diseases. To conclude, the doctors should play a key role in educating the patients. This, however, does not mean that the media and schools have no responsibility to build a healthy society. They should contribute their bit by telecasting / airing programs about health issues. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"The importance of public libraries is undeniable. While some people argue that libraries should be more focused on stocking printed books and materials than investing in digital resources, in this essay, I would argue why availability of digital media is crucial in libraries used by general public. First of all, the last few decades have seen dramatic growth in the use of digital media such as electronic books, learning software and other audio-visual learning and reading materials. This is because these resources are not only easy to carry but also convenient to learn from / to use in many innovative ways. For example, there are many free websites on the Internet which provide free video lectures for better understanding of a topic. If there are only hard bound books in the stacks and they do not provide these resources, they will become unattractive to general public. As a result, the significance of libraries itself may become questionable. More importantly, modern generation is time poor and they want to access everything quickly including knowledge, which printed books may not always be capable of providing. This is because the growing competition and advanced life style demand more skills and knowledge in a very short time.   For instance, youngster might prefer to listen to the summary of a book converted to the form of a video rather than reading full text. Moreover, important part of digital resources may be emailed to personal devices with the permission of the library, and the same may be accessed later anywhere. To conclude, although printed books will never lose their importance, the new generation / the young generation is moving towards digital information and learning. In my opinion, I would prefer to access digital and attractive video content in a public library instead of going through lengthy printed text.",8,True,79.58860759493672,300
"Sharing information in scientific research, business and the academic world is considered to be beneficial; however, on the other hand, it is also believed that some information is confidential that it cannot be shared freely on a public forum. In my opinion, sharing information has both advantages and disadvantages. Hence, let’s ponder over the given statement and discuss both viewpoints. In the field of scientific research, business and academic world, most of the people work upon creating something new in their respective fields. Information pertaining to such fields is always confidential in nature and generally it is advisable not to share it on any public forum. There have been several cases of people quarrelling over the ownership of research journals or other innovations shared on public platforms.  On the other hand, sharing information about any product on a public forum can result in the production of a better product and this will not have been possible if they had kept the information secret. Most of the multi-national companies such as Apple, Alphabet etc. launch a beta version or lab tested version of their product to see the reactions of general public. On the basis of their reactions, the companies decide whether to proceed or to drop the idea for production of that product. To conclude, I would like to say that every rose has a thorn and sharing information publicly has its own pros and cons. In my opinion, information shall be kept confidential until a full-fledged product is formed. Once such products are launched due credit is given to the inventor then only one should invite others for their view points and ideas to improve the performance and efficacy of the product.

"Technological advancement has a great impact on human race especially the working class. Some believe that it has assisted the labourers while others criticize their statement. This essay will discuss both sides and prove why this development is a boon for workers. With the introduction of automatic technology in workplaces, the work load on employees has plunged / has reduced. The tasks that earlier required 10-20 people, are now achieved with one machine. Moreover, these gadgets have enhanced accuracy and performance in business projects. The data can be sorted and presented at the click of a mouse button. For example, with a Powerpoint presentation we can narrate every aspect of a project and there is no need to carry a bundle of documents.  However, others also criticize about the problems that has resulted from this innovation. The major reason is that with the introduction of technical equipment the requirement for workforce has reduced which in effect has increased the unemployment rates. A survey by the Economic Forum of India has shown that 25% of people have lost their jobs in the past 3 years. Others also argue about the risks involved in operating gigantic machines in manufacturing companies. Any malfunctioning of the equipment may cause serious injuries to the workers using them.  Personally, I think technology has benefitted workers in numerous ways. While it is true that it caused the loss of jobs in certain sectors, it also created many more jobs in other sectors. Also, safety concerns can be alleviated to a great extent by taking appropriate safety measures.  In conclusion, technology in the business environment has both pros and cons. However, if the job loss and safety concerns are controlled wisely, it will undoubtedly revolutionize the employee’s performance and thus the productivity of an organization.",8,True,87.14580180308508,293
"Safety concerns have become increasingly common among certain demographics of the society. These people feel unsafe both in public places and at homes. The fear of safety is mainly because of the increased crime rate and limited police patrolling in public places. There are several solutions which should be implemented to deal with the safety concerns of people. Firstly, the main reason for feeling unsafe in public and at home is the increment in the crime rate over the past few years. Nowadays, the criminals are using all sorts of tactics to rob people of their hard earned money. Moreover, cyber crime has opened another channel for criminals. Another reason why people feel unsafe is the lack of adequate police force. As a result, police cannot patrol public and residential areas effectively. People naturally feel safe and secure when adequate numbers of police personnel patrol their area.  There are two effective solutions to tackle safety concerns at home and in public places. One way to improve safety is to reduce the crime rate by ensuring rehabilitation of first-time offenders. This method will ensure reintegration of criminals into the society. Another method to improve safety concerns is to recruit more police force and increase round the clock patrolling in public and residential areas. A recent study in Australia has shown that 83% of people feel naturally secure when they have some security arrangements around them.  In conclusion, reducing the crime rate and increasing patrolling are effective methods to enhance the safety of people. If the governments worked aggressively in both the areas, the society will feel much more secure.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Many species of plants and animals have died out over the last few decades due to human activity and climate change. Most of the time, climate change leading to the extinction of wildlife is also a result of human activity; yet, humans are not doing much to save these flora and fauna. The main reason for this indifferent attitude is the lack of understanding of the way the ecosystem works. Creating awareness is the only solution. Humans are not doing anything to save wildlife because they are under the impression that the universe is created for them. They believe that other forms of life were created to benefit them. Consequently, they do not see any reason to protect them. They kill them for food and to satisfy their greed. For example, animals like tigers and crocodiles are killed for their skin. Elephants are killed for their tusks. Animals are also used in medical research and this causes permanent damage to them; yet, humans do not find anything morally wrong about this practice. Most people seem to be under the notion that if they are rich they can live comfortably on this planet even after all the plants and animals have died. Unfortunately, they do not realize that any disruption to the food chain will threaten their very existence.  Creating awareness is the need of the hour. People should be sensitized about the damage they are doing to themselves by abusing wildlife. Right from primary school, children should be taught to respect and conserve all forms of life. Until we realize that we are threatening our own existence by allowing other forms of life to die we will have no motivation to act. In conclusion, human beings are not doing anything to save other forms of life because they do not see any value in it. Creating awareness is the only way to nudge them to act.

"Academic grade plays a pivotal role in building a successful career. Therefore, it is always advised that students should focus on their studies well. However, we have seen that many people who have become successful failed in their school exams. This essay will discuss the reasons behind this scenario and also highlight the factors crucial for achieving success in life. To commence with, I would like to say that success and failure are part and parcel of life. Success surely gives us happiness but failure provides us determination and motivation to work hard the next time. This is one of the major reasons why children who fail in school work hard on their shortcomings. Another point to consider is that many kids do not take their academics seriously during their young age. However, when they mature, their personality transforms completely. Furthermore, some students take interest in other fields like sports, art, music etc. Hence, they do not focus on their studies well. Lastly, I personally believe that there are a good proportion of people who do not like to simply cram for their exams. They become successful because of their creativity and their desire to do something different. There are numerous factors which help to achieve success in life. Firstly, I believe that hard work is the key to success. We should work hard and have some patience and perseverance to obtain desired results. Secondly, our goal should be clear. If we do not have a clear target, our hard work will be of no use. Thirdly, we should not get de-motivated by the obstacles that come in our way. We should try to fight with all the odds courageously. Fourth, we should try to take risks as and when required because they can give you a better result. Lastly, we should try to enhance our knowledge and we should keep on learning new things as they can help us in long run.

"It is argued that needy and poor people ought to be provided with housing facilities by the authorities. This essay agrees with this statement because when the government provides homes poor people do not have to worry about finding shelter and this enables them to focus on other major issues. This way, the government can maintain the happiness index and solve many social issues. Humans do hard work diligently for buying a house so that their loved ones can live securely. This is the primary reason for which major requirements such as children’s education is ignored by the people living below the poverty line. As a result, it hinders the overall development of the nation. Children from low-income families are forced to work at a young age so that their income can contribute to building a roof for the family. For example, in developing nations like Bangladesh, more than 55% of individuals do not have a home and their focus is to own a house by compromising the education and health of their offspring. Another reason why no-cost housing should be given to the people who cannot afford it is that it can help in lowering the stress which most people carry throughout their life. This as a consequence, can boost the happiness score and improve the health of the country. In many developing nations, high stress levels caused by poverty and homelessness lead to health problems like hypertension and heart trouble. For instance, the proportion of people who are healthy and happy in Switzerland is more than 75% because the government is primarily focused on developing new homes for needy ones and provides full support in lowering the stress involved.

"Museums and historical monuments help us to connect with the past. While many foreign tourists visit these places to know about the culture of that area, local people rarely visit them. The main problem is the lack of promotion and maintenance of these historical sites. However, if the government takes proper action, the popularity of historical places can be increased among the locals.  The tourists visit the historical sites and museums of other places because they are curious to know about the ethnic origin of those places. However, these historical places are losing their importance among locals due to the lack of interest in exploring them. In other words, they know about their indigenous cultures from their ancestors. Besides, there are many cultural books and online forums, which provide abundant information about their local history. Hence, these people lose their interest in going to these historical sites, especially if they are in dilapidated conditions. However, the situation can be improved by following a few simple steps. First, the government should advertise the value of the museums and historical places through the local satellite channels. Additionally, more archeological artifacts should be kept and promoted in different media to entice the native people. Second, the government should utilize some of the funds for refurbishing historical places and maintaining the museums. These methods can certainly build curiosity among these people up to some extent. To recapitulate, few local people are visiting heritage sites and museums because the government does not promote them among the locals. Nevertheless, this situation is still not out of hand and the interest of the native people can be developed through various promotional techniques and appropriate maintenance.

"It is true that in some societies, the crime rate has been increasing among young children. Some people argue that teenagers ought to be given the same punishment that adults get, if they commit a major offense. However, I completely disagree with this point of view. There are several reasons supporting the viewpoint why the adolescents should not be given the same punishment as adults. This is owing to the fact that teenagers have impressionable minds which help them to reform themselves easily. Put simply, a minor person is the one who can easily correct their behaviour with the help of counselling sessions. On the contrary, if the legal system gives them hard punishment, it can become difficult to change their criminal minds for the rest of their lives. Statistics reveal that the number of young convicts who reoffend has declined over the years due to the effective behavioural therapies in rehabilitation centres. Another possible reason why teenagers should be saved / protected from serious punishments is that their mental ability to choose the right and wrong direction do not get developed in this age. That means, this is that time when they imitate others without knowing the consequences of their actions. Hence, it is an awful idea to put minors behind bars and give them rigorous punishment. In conclusion, after analysing the situation it is not hard to see that juveniles can be easily reformed with counselling, it may not seem like a good idea to give strict punishment to them. Therefore, I believe that it is important to consider their age while giving penalty. In some countries, the number of youngsters involved in criminal activities is increasing. It is argued that youngsters who commit serious crimes ought to receive the standard penalty regardless of their age. I totally disagree with this viewpoint because children have impressionable minds so proper counselling can help to bring them to the right track. Secondly, law and order should be made as a part of their school curriculum. I will discuss these points in detail in the subsequent paragraphs. First and foremost, since children have impressionable minds, rigorous counselling can help them to overcome criminal tendencies. As they are in their growing phase, they develop such habits through their social circle or they try to imitate the movie actors. In the USA, as per the latest survey taken by the law authorities counselling has helped a lot of young minds to come to the right track and has curbed the crime rates to a large extent. Hence, it is clear that a soft approach such as counselling is an effective method to bring back adolescents to the correct path. Furthermore, law and order should be made as a part of their school curriculum which can further help them to better understand the legal system. We often see that adolescents are unaware of the intensity of crimes in which they get involved at a very tender age. Thus, making law and order as a part of their school studies can be an effective measure to teach and guide them. To illustrate this, as per Harvard Business Review, the educational institutions which teach law to their students have become successful in making them the good citizens of the society. To conclude, it is quite evident that proper counselling can play a crucial role in reforming the young minds of a country. Moreover, teaching law right from the school can further aid to curb the crimes rates. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"The advancement in technology has revolutionized each and every aspect of our life including the way we learn. For example, many educational institutes now offer online classes to aspirants sitting in different parts of the world. While some people favour this approach others prefer the traditional mode of learning. In my opinion, online classes are better than traditional classroom courses.  To begin with, there are many compelling reasons to believe that the internet has made it easy to pursue higher education. Primarily, online learning is beneficial for working professionals who cannot afford to attend a classroom course due to their jobs and hectic schedule. They can learn through online classes according to their convenience.  Moreover, learning online provides them a chance to choose from a large variety of study material as well as it saves their time and money. For instance, one can get thousands of video lessons on any particular topic and select the one which gives proper study guidelines. Classroom learning also has its advantages. It enables more effective interactions between the teacher and the student. If the student has a doubt, they can seek an immediate clarification from the teacher. This makes learning easier. However, classroom courses have their limitations too. For example, they tend to be more expensive than online courses. Also they have fixed hours which makes them unsuitable for working people. By contrast, anyone can join an online course and study at a time convenient to them. On balance, online courses have many features that make them more suitable than classroom courses for most learners. Of course, online learning still has many downsides, but as technology develops, many of these problems will be resolved. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"People’s opinion seems to differ as to whether or not museums should charge a fee for allowing visitors to enter. While some people argue that the entry should be free to such places, I strongly believe that a charge should be levied for the entry. There are myriad reasons to advocate the entry fees for the museums. First and foremost, a museum is a place where artifacts from the past civilizations are exhibited. Hence, to maintain and preserve them from dust and decaying, a maintenance fee is collected from the visitors. Secondly, an entrance ticket filters out unnecessary crowd from entering the museum premises. It actually discourages the uninterested and anti-social elements of the society such as beggars and vagabonds from entering. Furthermore, most of the museums offer world class facilities such as air conditioned halls, safe drinking water, cafes and seating arrangements for visitors. Such facilities are not possible without collecting a fee from the public. In addition, a museum may need to upgrade its technology and add more to its existing collection from time to time. Finally, a museum reflects the traditions, cultures and beliefs of a bygone-era. Therefore it becomes imperative to maintain it with the best possible facilities and latest technology. It is often seen that well maintained museums are thronged by the local people as well as tourists and thus they boost economy of a nation. To encapsulate, I agree with the statement that entry fees plays an important role in the upkeep of the museums and it should be charged from the visitors.",8,True,50.22073170731707,259
"Television is the main source of entertainment in many homes. Compared to a few decades ago, today almost every home has a television set. Some people think that TV brings more fun to an individual’s life, but others that believe watching TV is a waste of time.  In my opinion, watching TV is good if we can limit the amount of time spend on this activity.  On the one hand, television has evolved from what it used to be a couple of years back. Today there are numerous informative channels that children and adults can benefit from. People are updated with information from around the world through live 24 hours news channels. Channels like Discovery, BBC, and National Geographic provide information and knowledge to kids and it can be helpful for their science classes and other subjects. Secondly, television brings all family members to the living room. Today, with the help of technology, a plethora of online movie apps are present on modern televisions. For example, apps such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and many more bring the latest movies to home and it makes watching movies fun at home with family instead of going to movie halls which is expensive nowadays.  Therefore, television is playing a major role in making families happy and providing valuable information to kids and adults.  On the other hand, television can become a spoiler, when people do not set limit on the time spent in front of it. Individuals spend numerous hours watching TV which makes them lazy and unhealthy. For example, children spend a lot of their time watching cartoons and other movies today. They should be encouraged to engage in outdoor games so that they become healthy and not lazy.  To conclude, television can be beneficial if a person limits the amount of time spent in front of it. If too many hours are spent on viewing TV then it is wasting one’s time.

"Many people insist that the government must take adequate steps to improve the living conditions of the marginalised society. I completely agree with this view as the poor and the destitute need government assistance to be part of the main stream. There are multifarious reasons to strengthen my viewpoint. First, the government is elected by all the citizens of the country. So, it has to cater to the needs of everyone in the society. More importantly, the government has to put in extra efforts to lift the living standards of the paupers and the destitute. In fact, every government in the world dreams of an egalitarian society and this design can only be fulfilled if the government takes the responsibility to aid unemployed and homeless people with jobs and shelters respectively.  Similarly, other than providing employment and housing the government has to take the responsibility for the health and education of the vulnerable society. Making them more educated and giving robust healthcare definitely improve the economic condition of the country in near future. However, there are a few people who express apprehensions over the financial burden on the country if the government earmarks funds for the underprivileged.  I believe it is a short-sighted view as the unemployed on giving jobs become part of the workforce, eventually ramping up the productivity. In conclusion, although providing aid to the unemployed and homeless puts pressure on the economies, it is of utmost importance to blur the lines of inequality. Because of all these fundamental reasons I firmly believe that the government must take active steps to ameliorate the living condition of poor.",8,True,59.11462269311364,269
"Nowadays, traffic congestion and pollution are among the major concerns around the globe. It has been said that increasing the cost of petrol could be a viable solution. However, it has some negative impact too. In my opinion, there are other effective measures to solve this issue. To start with, increasing the price of fossil fuels will definitely reduce the use of private vehicles to a certain extent. Nevertheless, it will have an adverse impact on the middle class families and as a result will disturb their financial budget in a greater way. To cite an example, in the year 2014, unexpected hike in petrol prices had lead to controversies and for almost a month public transportation and taxis stopped working. In other words, local people suffered a lot during that period. Alternatively, we can opt for other options which are more effective and convenient. Firstly, the government must promote the use of electric vehicles and at the same time automobile industries should also start bringing more eco-friendly four wheelers. Secondly, we should also contribute our bit towards the welfare of our country by using public transportation. For instance, In London, the majority of the population uses buses and trains for travelling. To encourage people to use public transport, the government should start investing in the maintenance of roads and railways.  To conclude, raising the cost of petrol alone will not give the desired result. However, promoting the use of public transportation and its benefits will help to overcome the problem of traffic jams. Also, introduction of electric vehicles will reduce pollution to a great extent. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"My family has been planning to move to the United States of America due to multiple personal and professional aspirations. Though before taking the final call, there are some key factors which we need to consider. Immigration has become a norm nowadays in India as families see it as a great way to achieve a better lifestyle and standard of living but cultural differences, climatic conditions, wages and education are the major areas of concern.  When you move to another country, you are likely to experience a cultural shock due to massive difference in cultures; this is something that concerns me the most. The US, for example, is known for its rich, modern and liberal culture which is in contradiction to the Indian culture, where people are still conservative and orthodox. Such cultural variations will indeed affect our personal and professional life. While some people might ignore / overlook this, climate is another concern that bothers me. The US is known for its chilling winters where temperature can dip up to -30 degrees in areas like Alberta. Indians, on the other hand, hardly experience such winters, making it difficult for us to bear such freezing temperatures. This can even lead to health issues as our bodies are not habituated to them.  My last concern is education. Will the foreign country acknowledge our education? Will it be sufficient to land us in a well-paid job? At this age, I am really not in the position to re-join a graduation school just to get another degree from a new country to prove my credentials. For instance, the Indian education is more theoretical whereas the US imparts more practical knowledge to students from a young age. We will have to closely examine all the above points before we come to a conclusion and assess if opportunities outweigh challenges.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"While certain people choose to work for a company/organization as a salaried employee, others want to work independently. I advocate the self-employment option and in this essay, I will substantiate my viewpoint by comparing both the working scenarios.  Firstly, self-employment gives more work-satisfaction than working for someone else because it gives freedom to choose the domain and hours of work. On the contrary, in salary based employment, employees’ tasks, working hours and deadlines are determined by their higher authorities. Therefore, in self-employment, people do their work for the sake of their own satisfaction and not to satisfy someone else. Moreover, in regular jobs, the employees have no authority to change anything and have to follow the company’s protocols; however, in independent working arrangements, individuals have the liberty to implement any idea or strategy to improve their work. Thus, this freedom to work on their own terms improves their productivity. Furthermore, self employed people can earn as much as they want provided that they work hard whereas people working for others will get only a fixed salary. Therefore, the financial growth of self-employed people is in their own hands and they can increase it by working hard. To illustrate more, a salesman of a multi-national company never gets a share of the profit which he generates by selling products, but an entrepreneur has the privilege to have the whole profit for himself.  In conclusion, I would say that the self-employment option is far better than working for a company because it not only allows a person to work autonomously but also gives creative liberty to orchestrate a suitable working environment. Adding to that, the earning is proportional to the hard work and effort; thus, an independent worker can grow faster than a salary based employee. ",8,True,75.05298521368366,294
"It is argued that voluntary services  charity, cleaning the neighborhood, imparting knowledge to the underprivileged,  should be made mandatory in the high school curriculum. I strongly agree  as it not only helps in students becoming socially responsible adults but also in shaping their character.Firstly, community service inculcates a sense of responsibility towards the society, something that is needed to shape a good society. For instance, the introduction of Swatch Bharath scheme in my school, The Hyderabad Public School, ten years ago taught me not only to keep the surroundings of the school clean but also to never litter wherever I go. Hence, now I feel responsible to maintain cleanliness everywhere. Such services are needed to develop a better society in the future.Secondly, voluntary services cater to the overall character development of an individual. It  a feeling of empathy in children which is needed to build a better character. For example, an alumnus of Montessori High School, who indulged in petty law-breaking activities during school confessed that it was the charity service that he did in high school; which   in his mind;  him in becoming a better person for his family and refrained him from committing socially irresponsible acts. Thus, such voluntary activities teach us to value what we have and in turn  to our personality development.That being said, we cannot deny the fact that many students misuse the time allocated for these services by considering it as an excursion to enjoy with friends rather than a learning .In conclusion, although compulsory voluntary community service has its drawbacks, it is still useful in shaping a child as a socially responsible citizen and also in their overall personality development. Therefore, pupils should be encouraged to involve themselves in such activities.",8,True,70.36939626041901,288
"While some people opine that competition should be instilled in children, others disagree with this notion and believe that cooperation is more important, because by learning it children can become more useful adults. In my opinion, competition is more important than cooperation. This essay will discuss how growth is directly linked with the wish to compete, and although children can feel pressure because of the immense competition, it is better that they get familiar with such pressure at the early stage of their lives. Competition motivates people to outperform others because it allows them to assess their performance against the performance of others. This essay supports this point of view because it is commonly observed that the students of the schools where academic performance is graded and ranked with the objective of promoting competition do better in studies than the students of those institutes that do not follow the same methodology. People who support cooperation believe that the sense of competition puts unnecessary pressure on children; therefore, a relaxed environment where students can learn and cooperate with one another should be provided to them. I disagree with this thinking because it is crucial for children to cope with the pressure to compete during their childhood itself.  Moreover, it is often observed that children with difficult childhood perform better in practical life than other children. The reason is that difficulties faced at a younger age makes them well prepared for the challenges of adulthood.  In conclusion, although the sense of competition can make the childhood more stressful, it increases the probability of success in the practical life. Therefore, children should be encouraged to compete with each others at an early stage of life, as it will help them to become stronger and better human beings. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to some people, school is responsible for teaching their students how to take good care of their health and wellbeing; others insist that this is not the responsibility of the school. I agree with the former view. In my opinion, the school is the best place for children to learn about health and fitness. To start with, children spend a great deal of their day time at school and as a result, they have hardly any time to attend fitness classes outside of school. Moreover, they definitely prefer to attend fitness classes at school as it gives them some break / respite from their academic classes. Therefore, it is easy to teach them the ways to take care of their health at school premises. A good example of this is the bi-weekly fitness classes introduced by St. Patrick’s School in London. Ever since the programme was launched the number of sick holidays taken by students reduced by 50%. Secondly, children obey the words of teachers more seriously as they want to be in the good books of their teacher. Thus, when a healthy habit is taught by their school teacher rather than a fitness trainer or their parents, children tend to follow it religiously. In addition, at school children have the company of other children. This enables them to participate in team events like football or cricket.  In conclusion, I strongly believe that healthy habits and wellness should be taught at school as the students spend a large amount of their time there and school teachers have tremendous influence on young adults.

"The following is an essay submitted by one of our readers. In many parts of the world, people prefer living alone more than before. I believe this phenomenon is a negative trend due to many reasons which I will discuss in this essay. People who are living alone are more vulnerable to crimes. Living alone might encourage criminals to break into their house and steal valuable items or even kill the person if he or she tries to stop them. This happens because it is easy to threaten a guy than a group of people. People who are living alone have no one to help them when there is an emergency. For instance, a survey in Brazil found that 70% of robberies in Rio de Janeiro were committed in houses of people who live alone. Living in a house alone might cause loneliness. When a person lives at a separate place, he or she will not be able to interact with people for more than 8 hours a day at workplaces or classes because friends prefer to get together on weekends, not on weekdays. That’s why people who live alone would feel lonely and not like their peers who live with friends or family. Not to mention that loneliness might lead to an incurable psychological illness. To illustrate, the Guardian revealed that 80% of the visitors of psychiatric hospitals in the UK are suffering from loneliness because they are living alone. To conclude, living alone is a negative development since people who live alone would be vulnerable to crimes, and it might let them feel lonely as well.",7,True,69.6920497461889,265
"The idea of staying in the same job till retirement is changing. Many people try to build their professional life in multiple fields over the course of years. This requires hard work and passion to keep learning new things. Needless to say many middle aged people and even seniors are enrolling in various courses to acquire new skills.  In my opinion, rather than a fashion, switching jobss has become a necessity in many sectors because of the lack of job security.  To begin with, a few industries are rapidly changing in nature and individuals working in those get outdated sooner than expected and forced to look for other career choices. Technology, being one such field, is rapidly evolving every day. It registered huge growth in the last decade and a plethora of new technologies like artificial intelligence and internet of things are emerging now threatening existing jobs. People often find it challenging to keep them updated in such a dynamic industry and look to change their career after a short stint. For instance, 10 years ago, programmers used only a handful of languages to code their programs but today there are more than 100 languages that technologists use and learning everything is next to impossible. This forces people to learn new skills on the job and those who fail to do so have to switch careers. Ambition also encourages many people to change jobs frequently. Thanks to greater exposure to the world outside, people are now keen to pursue their passion and take the road less traveled. For example, nowadays, it is not uncommon for a doctor to give up his medical profession become a photographer or a vlogger at 40. People want to live their life to the fullest and discover their talents. The rising cost of living also encourages them to do multiple jobs.  To sum up, after analysing the situation, it is not hard to see that having multiple jobs is the norm of the day.

"Nowadays, a section of the society believes that having a unique product is the key to success in business. I do not quite agree with this view. There are lots of factors which influence the customers and the uniqueness of the product is just one of them. In the following paragraphs I will substantiate my view. To begin with, commercials / advertisements are essential to grab the attention of consumers. It influences people to buy those products. In addition, these days most of the business organizations hire celebrities as their brand ambassadors. Since people are always attracted to the stars, they never scroll down the page or switch to another channel. For example, Indian former cricket player Mahendra Singh Dhoni is the brand ambassador of the energy drink named Boost. Company sales records say that there was a dramatic growth in their sales after they began to use Mr.Dhonj in their advertisements.  Secondly, the product package and labelling have a vital role in boosting sales. Beautiful product covers may encourage people to buy and use those items. Sometimes manufacturers paste catchy captions on the cover to target consumers. Nowadays, we can see that companies are using oval and round shaped packaging to cover the product. For instance, Kinder Joy is one of the toffees marketed by Unilever company. They give oval shape and light colours to their package because babies are attracted to oval shaped things.  In a nutshell, a company cannot achieve success only by having a unique product. They also need to invest in promotions and use attractive packaging to grab the attention of the buyer.

"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.",8,True,90.3960979687194,338

"There are some people who opine that young employees possess more skills, knowledge and higher levels of motivation than senior employees working in the same organization. While I do admit that they have more technical skills, in my opinion, their level of knowledge and motivation are more or less on a par with those of senior employers.  The main advantage that young employees have over senior employees is that they are more tech-savvy. Youngsters grew up in the age of technology. They are adept at using all modern gadgets and technologies. Organizations especially those working at the cutting edge of technology require this expertise of young people and hence they give preference to them while recruiting people. For example, in the information technology (IT) sector technology becomes outdated pretty fast. They need engineers who are well-versed in the latest programming languages and hardware technologies. Needless to say most people employed in this sector are youngsters. Even so, it is not possible to say that youngsters possess more knowledge or motivation than seniors. Knowledge does not necessarily mean only technological knowledge. While youngsters certainly have an advantage over seniors in matters of technology, it is not possible to say that their knowledge of other aspects of work or life is more. Likewise, the argument that they possess higher level of self-motivation also sounds frivolous to me. Young people are less serious than seniors about their career. Actually, people in their 20’s are more concerned about enjoying their life than making significant contributions to their organization.

"It is often argued that the number of holidays awarded to employees should be in accordance with the nature of their job. I fully agree with this view.  Some jobs are physically and emotionally more taxing than other jobs. For example, people working in the armed forces require more holidays. Since they are more likely to work in places far away from their home, it is essential to give them a few months of holidays per year. This enables them to spend some time with their family and rejuvenate themselves. Likewise, people working in oil rigs or construction sites need more off days to stay physically and mentally healthy. Hence, it is essential to take into account the nature of the job while determining the amount of holidays each employee should get. On the flip side, people working in the same office should be given the same number of holidays regardless of their designation provided that the nature of the job is the same. For example, if the manager is given more holidays than lower level employees, it may create resentment among the latter. Also, if the manager or the supervisor goes on holidays too frequently, it will affect the productivity of the organization because of the communication gap between them and other employees. Hence, it is essential to avoid such situations by giving the same number of holidays to all the people whose job requirements are more or less the same. In conclusion, I agree with the argument that the nature of the job should be the main criterion used for determining the number of holidays each employee gets. Employees performing the same kind of jobs should get the same number of holidays regardless of their position in the organizational hierarchy.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In today’s world of globalization and rapid development, people have surpassed political and cultural boundaries in search of employment, and language plays an important role in this pursuit. English has been promoted as the means of communication to overcome this language barrier; hence, emphasis is put on learning this language at school. At the same time, other local languages are at risk of dying out simply because of neglect. I strongly feel that it is extremely necessary to start learning English at the elementary level, but local languages should also be given equal importance and steps should be taken to ensure their survival. To begin with, in the modern world, many people often travel to foreign countries to pursue higher studies or a better job opportunity. They need to communicate clearly and coherently. So they need to have a good command of English, and there is no better way to achieve proficiency in English than to learn it at school, like any other subjects. Even if somebody is not leaving their country, they may still have to interact with their foreign counterparts. Another advantage of learning English is that it opens up new job avenues. For example, a person can take up the job of a translator or an English language teacher.  In spite of all these advantages, I still opine that local languages should be given equal advantages. If they are not taught to the young generation, they run a high risk of extinction. With the death of a language, the corresponding culture also dies out. For example, a lot of artefacts have been excavated from the ruins of Harappa and Mohanjodaro, but their history has been hardly been deciphered because of our inability to read the already-lost language. There are many ways we can try to ensure the survival of these local languages. Parents and the elders should teach young people about the rich history associated with them. At the same time, the government should place greater value in teaching them and should make them compulsory in schools and colleges. Awareness should also be raised through adverts and campaigns over print and electronic media. It is finally the next generation and the generation after, who can save the languages from dying out. To sum up, I feel that learning English is no doubt highly important in today’s world, but special care should be taken for the survival of local languages as well.

"Some underdeveloped states today are gradually considering tourism as the main stay of their economy. I think this tendency will have both positive and negative influences. This article will discuss the reasons for this phenomenon and its effects. There are many developing countries like Nepal and Nigeria that lack enough investment and advanced technology to develop domestic manufacturing or other industries. In this situation, expanding tourist industries becomes a useful method to earn money from global tourists. Besides, the traveling industry is able to create numerous jobs which improve the economic situation of local citizens. This development has visible advantages for these countries. The countries that do not have a well-developed industrial system can benefit from tourism. Governments can take good advantage of this revenue by investing it in education, medicine and other fields. Furthermore, these countries are likely to increase their repute by virtue of their tourist attractions and earn even more tourists and money. However, this high-speed expansion of traveling industry also has a negative influence. The tourist industry is a highly dependant field which is affected easily by the international environment. It will become depressed when the world economy is in a deep recession. To make it worse, other relevant fields will be influenced at the same time. Eventually, it will cause a series of social problems like inflation and other social unrest question. Tunisia was a typical example of the situation. Its economy has not improved since the economic crisis in 2008. In conclusion, many underdeveloped countries expand tourism as they do not have the financial means to develop other industries. In my opinion, there are both advantages and disadvantages to relying on tourism. On the one hand, tourism helps the development of national economies; on the other hand, it exposes countries to the vagaries of the international market. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"In this modern era, it has been witnessed that most of the common people seek to imitate popular celebrities by following them on media sources such as magazines and television. This essay will discuss the factors that encourage ordinary folks to imitate famous people. Personally, I think this is a bad tendency.  To begin with, there are several reasons for this craze among people to follow celebrities. One of the main reasons is that people get attracted to the lifestyle of celebrities and also want to achieve the same in their own daily life. For example, recently an Indian guy bought the same luxury car owned by his idol M.S. Dhoni thinking that this would help him grab attention. People also imitate celebrities to look more stylish and to gain more acceptance in the society. For example, celebrity hairstyles are a rage among young people.  Although this tread of copying famous personalities is very common, it is not really laudable. Imitating famous people can only bring temporary joy to the common people. On the other hand, a person might gain permanent happiness by exploring his/her own originality rather than copying the style of celebrities. Furthermore, if a person lives his life in his own way, it boosts his confidence which leads to greater success in his life.  To sum up, it is irrefutable that most of the people attempt to imitate well known personalities to improve their social status and to appear stylish. However, this trend is not appreciable as common people lose their originality by copying others. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"There is no denying the fact that the number of students who graduate from universities is on the rise. Some people argue that since there are not enough jobs for all graduates, people should stop giving too much importance to university education. I do not quite agree with this view because finding a white collar job should never be the only objective of going to university.   It is now widely believed that a university education is essential for success in the workplace. And that is true. Graduates are likely to command better pay packets than undergraduates. Graduates are also more likely to get a promotion. There is one problem, though. While the number of graduates is on the rise, there aren’t enough jobs for all of them. That means a large of number of fresh graduates are unemployed because they can’t find jobs that meet their level of academic qualification. On the flip side, plenty of jobs are available in the labour sector. However, most graduates are reluctant to accept these jobs because they are looking for white collar jobs. When they can’t find those jobs they become discouraged. Does this mean that students should stop going to universities? The answer is an emphatic NO. Education is one of those skills that can never harm its possessor. One can never be over-educated. Besides imparting job-related skills, universities also make students better equipped to face the challenges of life. By not acquiring higher education a person will only impair his chances of success in life.  In conclusion, by not going to universities, we can’t solve any problem. What we need is a change in the mindset. We must realize that all forms of labour are dignified. We must stop thinking that because we are educated we should only work in office like environments.

"Discipline makes children always punctual, obedient and also well mannered. Because of these reasons discipline is an integral part of our lives. Some people think teachers are responsible for disciplining children while others think it is the duty of parents. In my opinion, both parents and teachers are responsible for teaching discipline to students. To begin with, it is said that home is the first school of children and family members are the first mentors, because children spend the first four or five years of their life at home with family especially their parents. At this stage of life, it is the responsibility of parents to make them understand the importance of discipline in life and also create a routine for them. For example, parents should set a time for them to wake up and play and when they join school they should make a time table for their studies. To illustrate, a survey conducted among the teachers of various schools concluded that children who are already trained by parents to be disciplined are easy to handle and also it is very easy to make them understand about school’s rules and regulations. I believe the involvement of parents in making the child disciplined is crucial and after the child starts school teachers have an equally important role to play.  Teachers take care of the children at school and as such their duty is not limited to teaching science and maths. They monitor the kids at school and have a responsibility to discipline them whenever they cross the limits. They have the authority to punish kids when they misbehave or indulge in activities that are harmful to themselves or others. If teachers ignore this responsibility and focus only on giving academic lessons, they are doing a serious disservice to their students and the nation. In conclusion, parents and teachers have equal contributions in making children well disciplined and also ensuring their success in life. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Advertising is considered as the most effective way of increasing sales of the advertised products, and the vast majority of corporations use this market tool. Some people believe that children should be taught about the deceptive marketing strategies employed by advertisers. I strongly agree with them. To begin with, both children and their guardians can benefit from learning how advertisers fool them into buying their products. It is widely acknowledged that advertising often uses some strategies, such as hiring movie stars to endorse their products so that they become more attractive. Children are not mature enough and do not encounter the hardships of earning money, so they are more likely to pester their guardians to purchase those frivolous, pricy and advertised products, and thus exert financial burden on their parents.  Another downside of falling into the trap of advertisements is that they often have a negative effect on the health of children. For example, some children are captivated by the adverts of convenient food and hence they consume an excessive amount of them. Unfortunately, consumption of these foods increases their risk of obesity and diabetes. It is important for children to understand that tasty food is not always healthy. It is also important for them to develop healthy eating habits from childhood. There are also some adverts that depict dangerous stunts. Children are too naïve to understand that these stunts are performed by experts that too under strict supervision and with the help of special effects. Unfortunately, many children do not realize this and they serious injure or even kill themselves while trying to imitate those dangerous stunts. In conclusion, it is imperative for children to learn about the tactics that advertisers use to coax them into buying their products. Knowledge of these strategies will not only ensure their health and safety but also save their parents’ money.",8,True,87.92203626956682,308
"Thanks to the advent of globalization, international corporations have opened their branches in every corner of the world. Consequently, the same products are available everywhere and this has made people and countries look the same. In my opinion, this is not exactly a positive change. I will support my stand with valid arguments in the following paragraphs.  First of all, when people everywhere buy the same products, cultural identities disappear. For example, in Shanghai, many foreign clothing companies sell T-shirts to local residents. As a result, few local people wear traditional clothes like qipao now and the traditional clothing industry is dying. Many young people cannot even identify their traditional clothing and fewer people know how to make traditional clothes. If the government took actions to help the traditional clothing industry, people would be able to keep their cultural heritage and craftsmen working in this sector would not lose their livelihood. Unfortunately, that is not the case and locals are forgetting their culture and ethnicity.  On top of this, buying the same stuff everywhere is bad for local economies and the environment. Oftentimes, products are imported from foreign countries and have to travel thousands of miles before they reach the end user. This does not help the environment or the local craftsmen. The only beneficiaries are multinational companies. Small businesses and manufactures cannot compete with them and quickly lose their market share and there is less demand for skilled workers who can produce goods with local features. Consequently, people employed in traditional sectors are becoming jobless. For instance, the young generation prefers fast food rather than traditional Chinese food. The market is shrunk for these people who make a living by selling traditional Chinese foods. Likewise, carpenters, cobblers, potters are all becoming jobless in the current scenario.  To sum up, the disadvantages overweigh the benefits when people begin to buy the same goods everywhere and different regions become more and more similar. In this scenario, the cultural heritage will be destroyed and the unemployment rate will rise. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"It is true that people are able to gain qualifications provided by universities and colleges via distance learning. Some people argue that people can benefit from this development and meet their learning needs. However, I believe that distance learning has more drawbacks than merits due to its lack of efficiency.  There is a commonly held view that distance learning can be beneficial for some people especially those in rural areas. This is because there are few universities or colleges in these areas due to the small population. If students can gain qualifications through distance learning, they can develop their skills, improving their employability. Another advantage of distance learning is that interested people can obtain knowledge in a variety of fields. For instance, if an Asian student wants to study how Western countries develop solar power, he/ she can easily enrol in the relevant course at an open university.    However, my strongly held opinion is that distance learning can certainly decrease the effectiveness of student learning. It is evident that students are likely to get distracted while doing a distance learning program as they might use their laptops to browse other websites which are not relevant to course contents. For example, it is widely known that learners cannot concentrate on online learning because they tend to get distracted by social media. In addition, learners cannot receive instant and constructive feedback from teachers, making the process of learning less efficient. If students are not able to focus on their learning, it is highly impossible for them to meet the requirements of qualifications.  In conclusion, although distance learning certainly enables students to acquire some academic qualifications, it is not an efficient way of learning and hence I think its disadvantages outweigh the advantages.

"It is often argued that the health conditions of a person will gradually degrade in the coming years. I tend to agree with this statement, because people are majorly relying on outside food and our air is too polluted for us to breathe it. Due to the increase in competition between various sections of the society, most people are under tremendous job pressure and can hardly take out time to cook food at home. Moreover, with easy access to various online food ordering options, many people like to order unhealthy and oily food as per their choice and this could adversely affect their health. For example, the famous home delivery option, Pizza Hut is open 24 hours and promises to deliver food in just 30 minutes. Such facilities attract the working population. Even if people decide to cook at home, the fruits and vegetables sold in the markets are laced with pesticides. As a result, many people are prone to developing health issues such as obesity and high cholesterol level. Environmental degradation is another factor that affects the health of people. Our environment is seriously polluted by the emission of poisonous gases from factories or from vehicles. Hence, the air we breathe is highly polluted and can affect various parts of the body, because, in the process of breathing contaminated oxygen is supplied to all organs of the human body, exposing them to serious organ failures. For example, according to a recent study conducted in India by expert environmentalists, 70% of the population has traces of carbon monoxide in their body, which can lead to several serious breathing ailments. To conclude, it is rightly said that in the coming years, most people will not be able to sustain an average healthy life. As explained above the reasons for this could be pollution and unhealthy lifestyle of people.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"The upbringing of a child is said to determine how successful they are / they would be in adulthood. I fully agree with this statement. In my opinion, the way the individuals were raised by their parents is a major factor in their success on both professional and personal level.  There is no doubt that upbringing influences people’s chances of succeeding in their  future careers. The parents teach their children the values they will follow later. For example, the parents who are ambitious, hard-working and diligent adults with successful careers will also teach their children the importance of being self-disciplined and working hard towards their goals. Learning such values will help them overcome obstacles in life and always focus on their career objective. By doing so, they will become professionals in their field and will attain success.  Furthermore, a good education does not only positively impact the professional success of an individual but it also plays a prime role in shaping the type of adult the child grows into. When the child is surrounded by love, care, dedication and attention from their parents, they will grow into kind, caring and empathetic people who respect other people, treat everyone equally and help those in need. They attain)success on a personal level because they do good to the society and they improve others’ lives.  In conclusion, I totally agree with the argument that a person’s professional and personal success in the later life is the outcome of their early upbringing. This will help them achieve success in their careers, and the love and care offered by the parents will turn the children into caring and socially responsibile adults.

"It is an irrefutable fact that the mode of communication has changed enormously with the advent of the internet. People prefer to use different technologies while communicating instead of having a face to face conversation. This essay will explain the positive and negative aspects of online communication. One of the most important advantages of using technology is that it helps to cross the geographical barrier. For instance, a person sitting in India can contact his European clients instantly using email or Skype. This can be beneficial for the expansion of his business as he can interact with people from all over the world. Moreover, this way of interaction helps to reduce a lot of overheads like travel expenses and the cost incurred for setting up a meeting destination. On the flip side, excessive dependence on communication technologies has its own disadvantages. To begin with, people lose the personal connect / connection when they refrain from face to face communication. This can make them feel lonely and depressed as they are devoid of social life and it can have a detrimental effect on their mental health. Furthermore, chances of fraud increase when we converse via phone or email, as we cannot verify the physical identity of the person we are interacting / conversing with.  To conclude, though technology has made communication easier and more convenient, there are numerous disadvantages as well if it is used excessively. So the mode of communication should be chosen judiciously taking into account several factors such as distance and time. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"While some people believe that change is unavoidable and makes life interesting, others opine that stability is more important for mastering any skill. Personally, I think that doing the same thing repeatedly is essential to achieve success and have a good social life.  There are numerous benefits to focusing on one thing in life. To start with, it provides the required anchor and stability in life so that an individual can focus on mastering one skill. It is often seen that if someone has acquired extraordinary skills in one field, they have high probability of achieving success in their life. For example, it is well known that most of the successful individuals worked in one direction with least distractions to gain reputation and success which came by having a stable life.  However, some believe that change is unavoidable and it prevents from becoming boring. It is argued that if we do not try to push our boundaries, we would never know what we can achieve in life. So, change often pushes a person to test their limits and capabilities.  However, in my opinion, this approach can be detrimental in the long term. Although change provides excitement and adrenaline rush, it is highly distracting and increases anxiety levels. A person with this mentality will avoid problems instead of facing them.

Although, e-books are easy to access from any corner of the world, I would always prefer reading paper books to avoid eyesight problems and some associated physical problems. In the current scenario, people are very keen to use the compact gadgets for almost everything in their daily routine. Advanced innovations have led to the inventions of pocket sized mobiles, palmtop computers and light weight Macbooks. Nowadays people need not worry about packing books during travel and there is no need to carry bulky printed books. Interestingly, almost all books are now available online and can be downloaded onto your device for free or for a small fee.

While it is true that it does have some weight and occupy some space, it is never too heavy or too bulky to carry in your backpack. Another advantage that printed books have over ebooks is that anybody can read them at any time. You do not have to be tech savvy to read your ebook. This feature of printed books makes them particularly suitable for the elderly who may find it difficult to use an ebook reader. Yet another advantage of ebooks is that they do not cause eyestrain like ebooks. There is also the nostalgic feeling associated with smelling the paper or flipping the pages.

"University education has become expensive these days and poor students have difficulty enrolling in. Therefore, some people argue that universities should help disadvantaged students to receive tertiary education. I agree with this view.  Education is the key to a successful life and career and as such everyone regardless of their financial situation or place of birth should have access to it. When poor students receive university education, they are able to find better jobs and thus elevate their living standards. For example, my neighour is a daily wage earner. When his children graduated from high school with good grades, they could secure admission in a government college for a nominal fee. Today both of them have high paying jobs and they are also an inspiration for other poor students in the neighbourhood. Obviously, education bridges the gap between the rich and the poor and thus helps to reduce inequality. By contrast, if poor students have to quit studies after high school, they will forever be doomed to live in poverty and that benefits neither them nor the society. By offering free or subsidised education to students coming from economically or socially backward sections of the society, universities can ensure that everyone has access to tertiary education. In countries like India the government already provides fee concession to meritorious students from poor families at state funded schools and colleges. The government should extend the scheme to private universities as well by offering them some financial incentives for doing so. It should also consider enacting laws that offer a fee waiver to academically brilliant poor students at all educational institutions in the country. Instituting more scholarships and stipends will also help.   In conclusion, education is the fundamental right of all students regardless of their financial or social backgrounds. Universities should help them achieve it by offering them scholarships and fee waiver to poor and meritorious students. ",9,True,76.45111374073004,314

However, a couple of solutions could be adopted to handle this situation, as will now be discussed.International tourists are often criticized for their contribution to the environmental degradation. It has continuously been noticed that they throw rubbish in their surroundings irresponsibly, which increases the amount of litter everywhere, despite all attempts to reduce waste produced by the local community.

"No doubt ideas and attitudes towards some aspects change with age. Sometimes it creates conflicts between two generations and there are a lot of problems due to this, which I am going to discuss in the upcoming paragraphs. To embark upon, when a person grows old it is but natural that his thoughts change. For example, when we were kids many of us refused to eat green vegetables. As we grew older and learned about the benefits of veggies, we started eating them. Other differences are about the choices of younger and older ones. For instance, while youngsters like to wear bright coloured clothes, seniors prefer light colours. Likewise, young people can be quite rash but seniors think twice before taking decisions. Often times parents want to impose their beliefs and value systems on their children while the kids want to follow the global culture. They want to follow the latest trends. Moreover, parents force children to choose career of their choice, but children like to walk on the untrodden path and explore more opportunities in that direction. All the differences mentioned above are the causes of many problems. First, children start disobeying their parents  and ignore their valuable guidance and land themselves in trouble. They are of the view that parents belong to older generation and cannot understand their problems and issues. The second problem is that youngsters leave their parents due to these generation gaps and to pursue their profession. This in turn is detrimental for both parents and youngsters. Both of them start living monotonous lives and are deprived of the much wanted love and affection. What’s more, this deprivation increases their stress levels and stress is the root cause of many heath related issues.

"There is no doubt that art education can play a vital role in the overall development of a child. Although some believe that including this including art in their curriculum is not worth their time, I would argue that it is a necessary subject that enhances their learning experience. On the one hand, those who believe studying art is time consuming and worthless might argue that it does not lead to a successful career. This is because many artists struggle to make a living. For instance, a painter may have trouble selling a single piece of his art. By contrast, if the same time is utilized for learning other more important subjects such as science or business at school, it is likely that it will result in a fruitful profession like medicine, engineering, law or architecture. On the other hand, my view is that it is very important to teach art at this stage because it imparts different life skills. The reason for this is that by practicing arts children can develop skills like patience, improved motor ability, better hand-eye co-ordination, creativity and many more. By completing a project and observing the rewards of hard work they build perseverance and unique way of thinking abilities, for example. Hence, if these skills are not taught at school, it may hinder the overall development of children.

"While economic development has lifted many poor people out of poverty and brought the public a better materialistic lifestyle, many people contend that this trend cause the loss of traditional value. I do not quite agree with this view. I am of the view that this trend has more merits than demerits which are manageable to a great extent. On the one hand, many benefits are brought because of economic growth. Firstly, it reduces poverty and improves the quality of life. While economy grows, more job opportunities are being generated. The income from jobs can help the society escape poverty and people can have a better standard of living. In addition, people can have access to education when they can afford the tuition fee. Through education, people gain a variety of knowledge in many fields, and learn how to use it for a better world.  On the other hand, there is no denying the fact that some traditional values are deteriorating because of the materialistic lifestyle brought on by economic development. For example, after meeting basic needs, people tend to pursue more luxurious items without cherishing the things they have already owned. Many children nowadays consider smart phone as a common stuff they should own. Additionally, with greater standards of living, humans think that everything can be bought with money, even friendship and love. When the society becomes like this, it is hard for us to trust others or build a true relationship. However, the social values can be restored / protected by imparting moral lessons from an early age. People can cultivate the correct moral values and stick to those principles even though the society may be changing.

As for the risk of losing social value it can be prevented by giving value education from an early age. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Nowadays, wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few people in many nations and they accumulate more and more wealth. Because of this the deprived sections of the society are becoming poorer and poorer. This essay will discuss some of the problems caused by this and suggest solutions for it. In some countries, much of the economy is controlled by a few large corporate houses and this leads to uneven distribution of wealth.  The small-scale business entrepreneurs therefore have to give up their business due to pricing competition that they cannot compete with the large-scale business holders. For instance, presently people go to supermarkets and hyper-markets to purchase the household things because of the low price offered by them. As a result, small vendors face a recession and they have to close their businesses. Another cause of this problem is that quality education is beyond the reach of poor people. They have to send their children to state funded schools where they do not tech very well. Many of these children eventually drop out of school to find employment. Since they lack education, they cannot find a good job or earn a decent salary.  Making education and opportunities available to everyone is the best solution to this problem. The governments can support and encourage the small-scale business people by providing special schemes and low interest loans to develop their business. Increasing the tax on imported goods in supermarkets and reducing the tax on indigenously made goods help the development of small scale business sector. In addition, the government must ensure that quality education is available for free to poor students.  To conclude, the gap between the rich and poor should be narrowed by providing free higher education to the deprived class and making loans and subsidies available for their business.

"Essay submitted by the student Due to globalization, many countries are joining their hands with other countries to create win-win opportunities. The important factors for developments of poorer countries are enhancement in the area of health, education and trade. However, the governments of other richer countries should accept more responsibility to help the poorer countries in those areas. Nonetheless, in my opinion, this should not be at the expense of developments of their own countries. It is inevitable fact that developed countries spend millions of dollars for research in different areas. However, this money can be spend for development of under developed and developing countries. The governments of richer countries can help to poorer nations in the areas of health, education, trade etc. by providing aid for different purposes. They can enhance public health by providing advance medical facilities. Moreover, they should always embrace students in their countries by providing them higher education and liberalizing visa process. This would help their own countries as well. It may bring cultural diversity and a sense of tolerance among the people of their own countries. For example, the US government provides funds for aids patients in Uganda which is really helpful for under developed country like Uganda. Nevertheless, richer countries should not provide funds at the expense of development of their own nations. The governments should appropriately estimate budget required for their own countries and then after only excess funds can be allocated for helping the poorer nations. In conclusion, the governments of richer nations should help poorer nations for development and improvement in different areas provided that they have excess funds and resources available to them.  ",7,True,58.45544030931308,274
"Oil, gas and coal are all non-renewable resources. This is known worldwide, as well as the fact that society lives above its demands. Even though fuel prices have increased significantly over the last decade, consumption will still cause these resources to run out eventually. It has been argued that the only way to decrease the usage of fuel is to further increase the prices.Currently, most people think in the present and do not consider the future enough. Therefore, to affect people in their everyday lives, fuel prices ought to be raised. It is theorised that this will significantly decrease fossil fuel usage, as economic impact will be forced onto current users. It is necessary that fuel prices are high enough to immediately decrease the wealth of a family and make more people switch to public transport. Critics of this would argue, however, that society’s fossil fuels, such as petrol for cars, have an inelastic price and that price hikes would have no effect other than increasing tax and oil company revenues.In addition, a significant increase in prices would not only impact each individual, but also a whole economy. Fuel prices are not only linked to transport, but also to food production, home heating and entertainment. A rise in prices in all these areas would seriously affect the standard of living of families with limited income and would mean the poorer parts of society would become even poorer.In conclusion, while raising fuel prices is one of the most commonly-discussed solutions to fuel usage problems, this answer includes too many negative variables. Certainly, increasing fuel prices would create a small reduction of transport usage, but the far-reaching effects would be unfair and unsustainable.  ",9,True,80.07438223051096,281
"Sample essay In this twenty-first century, it is surprising that many people still have no homes. Some people argue that the governments should help the homeless by giving them money. I do not agree with this argument. In my opinion, giving cash to homeless people will only worsen the situation. Homelessness in most cases is a result of laziness. When the government rewards it with monetary help, the homeless people will have no motivation to earn money to enjoy home ownership. Instead, they will want to continue to enjoy government benefits. Worse, people who are already struggling to make a living will start assuming that being homeless is the easiest way to gain help from the government. So instead of doing anything to improve their living standards, they too will start queuing up for benefits. Being homeless is a miserable state. Also it does not reflect well on a society when people sleep on the streets. So, in order to help the poor people, the government should put them in a community shelter for a limited period and also get them involved in some work. To improve their employability, the government should give them vocational training. And once they have acquired the necessary skills they should be encouraged to find a job and a home on their own. If the government continues to give them financial assistance, they will not do anything to improve their living standards. To conclude, instead of giving financial benefits and free accommodation to homeless people, the government should provide them with training that will help them to find a job and earn money. And when they have money, they can buy a home on their own.",9,True,60.69438040345821,281
"There are many people who question the existence of zoos in the 21st of century. In their opinion, keeping animals in captivity is unethical. While I do agree with this view, I do not think that zoos should be abolished. In spite of all the arguments against the existence of zoos, the truth is that they still benefit both humans and animals. Zoos provide education. They give us an opportunity to observe wild animals from close quarters and learn about their behavior. Another very important benefit of maintaining zoos is that they save many endangered species from extinction. Zoos provide them with a safe environment where they can live and reproduce. Without zoos many exotic species of animals would have disappeared from earth. The argument against the existence of zoos stems from the fact that they ill-treat animals. That is true to a certain extent. In many zoos, animals are kept in small enclosures where they cannot even move about. Such zoos exist with the sole purpose of making money by exploiting animals. In my opinion, such establishments should be closed down as we have no right to use or exploit other forms of life for our benefit. Having said that, there are also zoos that allow animals to live in protected environments that are closer to the wilderness. Animals living in such zoos do enjoy some amount of freedom. They might even be able to hunt small animals that the zoo authorities throw into their ‘territories’. Life in such zoos actually benefits these animals because they are safe from poachers who might otherwise have killed them for their skin, teeth or tusks. To conclude, when we consider the benefits of zoos, it is not hard to see that the argument against their existence does not hold water. Zoos do protect animals. Instead of abolishing them, what we need to do is to make them more animal friendly.",9,True,73.94832402234637,318
"Some people believe that developed nations need to help refugees from countries affected by war and provide them with the basic necessities. I agree with this view because rich countries have enough resources to sustain poor people. Rich nations have the financial resources to sustain these people whose needs are basic.The countries like the UK, the USA  and Germany have huge budgets which are collected in the form of tax from their citizens and companies in their territory. It is not a big deal for these countries to use their resources for the benefit of affected people. For example, the estimated GDP of European Union is over $25 trillion and all Syrian refugees could be resettled for a less than a billion dollars. Wealthy countries have a moral reason to support. Refugees come from lands ravished by war and hunger. Nobody wants to leave their home turf and their families unless it is essential to do so and if these countries refuse to take them in, they will certainly be in danger of losing their lives. For example, people from Syria have no food and they are disturbed with the war environment and that is the main reason nearly 8 million of them have tried to flee their country. In conclusion, the rich nations need to provide help to resettle refugees because they can afford it easily and thus they can help to save many lives. All over the world people have the same basic needs and it is not fair them to deny them that just because they belong to a foreign country.",7,True,64.64325029204012,262
"Nowadays most information is transmitted over the Internet. A strong dependency on this medium has been created, as personal, political and economic news and information are shared through it. As the Internet is so widely needed, many people believe that governments should provide this access for free. Others believe that Internet access should be paid for.Before the creation of the Internet, people had phones, newspapers and televisions; nowadays the Internet can replace all of these. Society is now built on a system that relies on everyone having access to the Internet, whether this be in school or in work life. However, while it is seen as a basic necessity in western cultures, the costs for accessing it are still too high for some people. When this point of view is taken into account, it can be concluded that governments should provide access, or a division of inequality will be created in society.However, when one takes into account the things that the Internet has replaced, it becomes apparent that most of these are not free as well. It is necessary to pay for phone calls, for television and for newspapers. Storing all the information and passing it to consumers through the World Wide Web also entails costs. This raises the question whether the Internet should be handled differently. Providing Internet access to everyone would mean a significant cost for the governments, especially at times of economic crisis. Therefore, this is not a plausible solution to integrate each individual into the society.In my opinion, while the Internet has become as necessary as a phone, governments should not provide it for free, as the money needed for this would put too much strain on public resources. This finance could be used for even more urgent topics, such as poverty and starvation.",9,True,71.13808664259928,298
"When we study the biographies of highly successful people one thing that strikes us is the fact that they devoted their entire life to their cause. They cared for nothing else. It was this single minded devotion that helped them leave a mark behind. However, this does not mean that work-life balance is not required. Neither does it mean that just because someone spends their entire life in the workplace, they will be as famous or successful as Mohandas Gandhi, Albert Einstein or Steve Jobs. People like Gandhi or Martin Luther King had just one mission in their life. They believed in a cause and were ready to lay their life down for that cause. Consequently, they did not care about work-life balance. Actually, their work was their life. This is not the case with the average Joe. The vast majority of people work with the sole objective of making a living. They are not exactly concerned about leaving indelible footprints behind. They only want a secure source of income. Work-life balance is important for them. In fact, if they don’t get adequate leisure time and family time, they will wilt under the work pressure. Another thing to consider is job satisfaction. Many people do not like their jobs; yet they go to work every day because they want to put food on the table. They want to send their children to school and pay bills. They want a home and perhaps they also want a car. Actually, the only reason for them to work is to earn money to lead a comfortable life. And comfort can only come from having adequate time for oneself and all the other things that one enjoys.

"It is believed by many that there is no need to go to movie halls anymore since we can now, watch movies on our mobile devices and tablets as per our convenience. On the other hand, a few others think that films can be completely enjoyed only in a cinema. This essay will discuss both these views and will explain why watching films on electronic devices is a better option in today’s time and age. With the advancements in technology, life has become comfortable and convenient like never before. These days accessing a high definition quality movie over the internet is a very simple task. Portals like Youtube, Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hotstar provide a variety of options of different genres of movies to choose from. Additionally, watching movies at home is better suited to people with time constraints. These people can easily pause and play the picture as per their liking and schedule. However, watching films in a movie theatre has its own advantages. Many people still enjoy films in theatre because of the bigger cinema Screens, Dolby surround sound system, quieter environment and no distractions. All these factors give a superior viewing experience while watching the movie. To exemplify, an action scene in a 3D film has a powerful and a more realistic impact on its audience in a cinema hall than when it is watched on the small screen of mobiles. In my opinion, seeing films on our gadgets is a better option in terms of saving time and money. This is mainly because it gives us the freedom to watch the movie as per our schedule and helps in saving a substantial amount of money which goes into buying expensive movie seat tickets and refreshments thus making it a more appealing choice for many especially the youngsters.",8,True,91.85923423423424,301
"Over the last few years there has been an increase in the number of parents who choose to educate their children at home. Home schooling is becoming more popular because it is convenient and cheap. However, in my opinion, it is not as beneficial as regular schooling because it provides children hardly any opportunities to interact with their peers or the world outside. Parents are increasingly choosing home schooling for their children because it allows them to study at a time and pace convenient to them. This is quite beneficial for very young children as they do not have to get up early in the morning and rush to school. Learning from the comforts of home is also suitable for students who learn at a slow pace. Another advantage of home schooling is that it is cheaper. If parents are educated, they can teach their children themselves and thus save a lot of money on school fee. Parents also have the option of tweaking the curriculum to suit the specific requirements of their child. For example, they can add an extra language to the curriculum or remove another subject that they think is not useful for their children. Even so, in my opinion, regular schooling is more beneficial for the overall development of children. In a school, children get to learn from experts. Another advantage is the opportunities for social interactions provided by a school. A school is a microcosm of the world outside and in a school children learn a lot of invaluable life skills like the ability to interact with friends, peers and teachers. They learn to share, make friends, cooperate and compete with their classmates. Home-schooling does not provide any of these advantages. While it may be more convenient and cheaper it does not help to mold children into confident adults who know how to successfully conduct themselves in the world outside and solve problems.    In conclusion, home-schooling is becoming more popular because it is more convenient, flexible and less expensive. However, in my opinion, it is not as beneficial as regular schooling because it does not provide enough opportunities for social interactions.",9,True,68.38877740616871,356
"Millions of people around the world are changing the way they shop. There are two main kinds of buying products which are online shopping and physical shopping. These days remote shopping is increasingly becoming popular among customers which lead many people to think that in the near future this trend will entirely take over the role of retail stores. From my point of view, I think two main factors of this are the achievements of technology and many advantages of online shopping. However, I believe that it cannot completely take the place of brick and mortar shops. Since the advancement in technology, it is showing an impact on different walks of life including the way of shopping. Online shopping completely depends on modern technology and many scientists have been working on this to develop for a long time simultaneously in the field of shopping malls has fewer people who actually care about its improvements. For example, one part of online shopping is the gadgets called drones that deliver products to the right next the door by flying in the air. However, customers cannot buy all type of commodities through the use of drones as the weight it can carry is limited. Another main cause of why remote shopping is replacing physical shopping is due to many benefits of it. Purchasing products online take a fraction of time and does not demand any additional effort. In order to purchase merchandise, all clients have to do is to just click the buttons and make payment via their pc or phones comparing to retail stores that consume much time. Also, the products shoppers bought are delivered themselves which does not require any additional physical activity. For instance, I frequently use online shopping and recently I have bought the headphone that took only two minutes to purchase. But, despite the many merits of remote shopping, it cannot completely replace physical shopping. Because there are still some products such as clothing that many purchasers often find difficulty obtaining these products online since it is impossible to check whether the size suits or not. In conclusion,  I strongly believe that in spite of the achievements and many better aspects of online shopping it cannot entirely replace brick and mortar shops.

"It is argued whether parents and teachers should enforce strict control on children’s behaviour or just let them behave freely. In my opinion, neither total freedom nor absolute control will benefit children; rather parents should monitor their conduct properly. On the one hand, too much control on children’s behaviors can affect the formation and development of some valuable abilities. Primarily, it will hurt the problem solving skill of children as this ability is cultivated and developed through trial and error. If parents and teachers put too much control on children, they will have no solutions for the problems they might face in future. It is more likely for them to consult their teachers and parents for suitable and effective solutions, which is the undesirable result of over dependence on others. Besides, children whose behaviors are highly controlled by parents and teachers may be restricted in imagination and creativity, which are essential to their academic performance and also the key to gain success in complicated tasks in the workplace in the future.  However, it is not to say that children’s behavior should not be monitored / supervised at all. Having no control on children’s behavior can lead to detrimental results. My primary concern is that children may fail to respect and obey laws and regulations and they may simply behave in the way they like. For example, children may misbehave by engaging in activities such as habitual lying or littering just to entertain themselves without realizing that they have already violated some regulations. On the contrary, if the parents and teachers discipline their children whenever they go wrong, they are more likely to become law-abiding adults or even contributing members of their community. In conclusion, I believe that both parents and teachers have an obligation to discipline children’s behaviors and educate them in proper ways, rather than enforcing strict control or permitting absolute freedom.

"According to some people, professionals working in the field of science and technology enjoy more respect than artists or musicians. I agree with this view and in my opinion this trend will continue unless the career prospects of artists improve.  Unlike science and technology, the art sector does not offer many employment opportunities. Actually, there are only a handful of artists who make a decent living from their profession. Most painters, singers and dancers are struggling to make both ends meet because they do not have enough platforms to showcase their talent. Art continues to be an entertainment form that people can enjoy in their leisure time and artists remain strugglers for life with no steady source of income. Despite the fact that they invested countless years for polishing their skill, many of them need another source of income to live comfortably. By contrast, science and technology offer plenty of opportunities. New inventions emerge almost every day and students who pursue a course in science and technology have guaranteed job opportunities. Obviously, people working in these fields enjoy more respect. While it is true that it requires the same amount of hard work and dedication for a scientist and an artist to achieve recognition in their respective fields, an artist earns considerably lower than a scientist. Because of this reason, most parents discourage their children from pursuing art at university. Actually, in almost all schools, art is considered as an extracurricular activity and only about one or two hours are allocated for teaching this subject in a week. Needless to say, children grow up thinking that there is no future in arts.  In conclusion, it is true that scientists and engineers enjoy more respect than an artist. This is mainly due to the low earning potential of artists. While there are a few extremely successful singers or artists who earn exceptionally well, the vast majority of art professionals are struggling to get by.

"It is argued that investing funds on arts and music is just a wasting of resources, and the authorities should spend this money on public sectors. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, the officials should allocate appropriate funding for both services. On the one hand, there are certainly ample reasons why people want the government to spend more money on public services. First and foremost, it improves the quality of life. For example, when the funds are utilized to build colleges and universities, it will help people to gain education and employment. Educated citizens are the biggest asset of any nation and hence in my opinion, providing better educational facilities should be the priority of any national government. Last but not least, with sufficient funding, the authorities can support other sectors like health, infrastructure and transport. All of these are crucial for the development of a nation and need sufficient funding.  On the other hand, there are many benefits if the officials support the arts. The plus point of preserving music and theatre is that it will help us to conserve our national identity. As we all know arts and culture are interrelated, so by allocating some funds to arts we can save our cultural uniqueness. Moreover, if the authorities stop supporting the music and theatre, they will see a great loss in terms of tourism. Most tourists visit a country to see their culture, and if travellers find nothing extraordinary about a culture, they are less likely to return. In conclusion, the government should use the balanced approach of supporting both public utilities and arts because both are important for a country to flourish.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is true that in order to create something new, a certain level of liberty / freedom is required. Some people argue that artists should have absolute freedom to write, speak, act and create. While I admit that new inventions or innovations require some sort of freedom, I would also argue that absolute free-will can hurt the emotions of others.  To commence with, there are numerous reasons why liberty is crucial to develop something which has not existed before. Firstly, the tendency of the human mind is that it can broaden the realms of consciousness if it is not restricted. Since humans are rational thinkers, they can present their unique pieces of art like paintings, stories, and songs not only to entertain people but also to deliver a humanitarian message to individuals. For example, great writers and artists like Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci and A R Rehman would not be able to produce great works, if they did not have artistic freedom. They were able to create such things and reach heights because of the autonomy and the independence of thoughts. Today, people all across the globe enjoy their artistic creations.  In spite of the aforementioned arguments, I would argue that the sheer freedom to express personal feelings or ideas can hurt the sentiments of other people. The world consists of people of different backgrounds, religions, and everyone has different perceptions and beliefs. For example, a caricature a God or Goddess of one religion can create resentment among people of that particular faith and lead to a chaotic situation in the society. Therefore, the government should limit their freedom. Besides, the lyricists and the musicians have a significant impact on people, especially youngsters. If they write obscene lyrics and sing vulgar songs, it would instigate the youth to indulge in vulgar acts. Therefore, artists should keep the influence of their content on young-blood in mind before presenting their ideas to the world.  To recapitulate, independence is vital for expressing thoughts. However, I believe that it is also important to apply some restrictions on creative liberty because artistic freedom cannot be at the expense of the values and sentiments of the society.

Some opine that parents should restrict the amount of time children can sit in front of these devices while others are of the opinion that children should be given a free hand. In my opinion, it is important to limit the screen time of children. To begin with, a persons’ overall development occurs during their childhood. If a child is addicted to laptops or mobiles during this period, it will affect their physical and mental capabilities and they may end up being lethargic and stubborn. For instance, my sisters’ son is habituated to having his meals in front of the TV. He will not eat if someone switches off the television. Adolescents need ample amount of physical and mental exercises to grow stronger and this can be achieved only if parents can restrict the usage of electronic items in everyday life by encouraging children to learn to play musical instruments or allowing them to engage in outdoor activities like playing football. Scientists have conducted various research programs across the globe and proved that children are more confident, happier and more expressive if they mingle with others of their age. On the other hand, youngsters who watch television for long hours are depressed and cannot express themselves freely in public.

However, some people think that robots are a perilous innovation threatening human beings. Here in this essay, both views will be discussed before my opinion is presented. One the one hand, robots are feasible substitutions for human labor in many fields. In surroundings that are unsafe for the employment of human labor, robots play an irreplaceable part in replacing workers today. For instance, they can be used effectively to remove radioactive wastes in nuclear power plants or complete tasks impossible for astronauts in the space stations. In addition, it is more productive for robots to perform trivial and repetitive jobs. The best example is industrial robots. They can work on an assembly line more efficiently than humans because they are tireless, fast and accurate. As robotic technology develops further, robots will be able to do more, benefiting human society in the upcoming years. On the other hand, the widespread use of robots has inevitably raised concern. Firstly, some people are quite skeptical about robots as they dread that one day these machines will become too intelligent to be controlled by humans. That would mean disasters for the human being. Another worry is that they would cause massive unemployment. Due to the adoption of various types of robots, there are thousands of workers who are laid off. Such a large unemployed population can pose a potential threat to social stability.  My view is that robots will become an indispensable part of the technology-dominated age.

"People have different views about whether women are capable of performing jobs / working in the police force or the army. In my opinion, despite the difference in physical strength and stamina between the two genders, women can play a significant part in these two areas. The main argument held by some against women serving in the army or becoming a police officer is that it is too demanding for females to qualify.  Unlike most normal jobs where men and women are on par with each other, being a soldier or a sergeant requires the applicant to be tough and strong physically and mentally. The work tends to involve a great deal of intensive training, and it can even be dangerous when confronting criminals or hostile forces. Therefore, women, who are generally less sturdy and more fragile, are not the optimal choice for these occupations. However, I agree with other people who contend that this is a narrow view. The fact is that women can play essential roles as men do in police offices and military camps. There are many jobs in these two fields that do not involve physical encounters. For example, nearly all police departments and armies need office clerks to work with documents and engage psychological consultants to help people out with their stress management. Women show obvious advantages over men for these positions because they are often more careful, receptive, and empathetic. In reality, secretarial work and counseling in armed forces and police stations are indeed dominantly taken on by females, and their contribution is not eclipsed by males’ at all. In conclusion, even though females may be less advantaged than males in terms of physical ability, the distinctive gender advantage they hold enables them to be competent at the work in troops and police departments.

"It is indeed true that people become lethargic or show less interest towards any physical activities these days because of work pressure and presence of many entertainment sources. This has many detrimental effects on their health such as obesity and heart disease in the long run. Hence, regularly spending a little time for physical activity is essential to improve health.  There are several factors because of which people do not get enough free time.

"Tourism is a fast growing industry. It is believed that in the coming years a bigger proportion of people would opt to go on vacations in their home country rather than going abroad. I disagree with the aforementioned statement and opine that traveling abroad is way more enjoyable. With the advances in travel industry, people will be further encouraged to travel to foreign destinations. To begin with, going on vacations to foreign places is more exciting than going to a local destination. This is primarily because on such trips individuals learn about new cultures, languages and traditions.

On the one hand, there are various ways in which technology has influenced the relationships of people. Firstly, telephones and the Internet allow people to interact instantly, thereby reducing the distance between them. In this way, this allows / enables people who are staying far away from families to be connected all the time. To illustrate, a survey conducted by a TV channel among people of various age brackets reported that 90% of them are in touch with their family and childhood friends through online applications like Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter. Secondly, Skype services are being used by teachers for online classes without affecting their relationship with the students.  Hence, advances in technology have made it easier for people to make relationships / people to interact with one another. On the other hand, there are several reasons why the quality of interaction has significantly declined due to technological development / development of technology. These days, individuals prefer online chatting rather than face-to-face interaction. This kind of communication is hazardous for children as they need to socialise more. Online interaction is affecting children’s social development because nowadays they are mostly seen indoors with their mobile phones rather than playing outside with their peers. For example, a magazine report in 2019 showed that 70% of mothers have complained to the school authorities about their juvenile’s extreme usage of cell phones and the Internet. Thus, technology appears to negatively affect the tendency of a child to socialise these days. To conclude, technology has made an enormous difference in people’s lives in terms of communication. However, I believe that technology also has some impact on people’s social and psychological development.",8,True,93.00949367088609,303
"Traffic congestion and pollution have become major problems worldwide. Pollution is particularly worse in the big cities. While it is possible that higher petrol prices will solve the traffic and pollution problems to a great extent, raising the price of oil is not the best solution. However, I believe that other measures are more effective. The main reason why raising the fuel prices is not the right solution is that it is the short-term measure. Although it might cut the number of vehicles on the road, it largely affects the prices of food and other goods. For instance, in India, my home country, everything relies on the transport. If petrol prices increase, the prices of commodities in the market will also increase. This will lead to inflation in the market which has a big domino impact on what people end up paying even for a slice of bread. A better solution is to find measures that will work in the long run. To illustrate, escalating the investment in alternative fuels and improving public transport are more effective measures than increasing petrol prices. Traffic and pollution problems will not be solved until people start using the public transport. For this reason, the government should make public transport available at cheap rates and prohibit cars from city centres. To conclude, this essay discussed how the growing population and worsening air quality have made it imperative for governments and people to adopt change and cut the use of private transport. However, in my opinion, increasing the cost of petrol is not the right solution for traffic congestion. Instead of taking this drastic measure, governments should invest in public transport and clean fuel. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some people subscribe to the belief that reading helps enhance language skills and creativity, whereas watching television does very little for these abilities. Personally, I support this opinion for several reasons, which will be laid out in this essay.As we all know, books use text to convey ideas and quite often there are no images or illustrations to picture the scenes described in the book; therefore, we have to use our own imagination while reading. For example, reading a fantasy novel that contains mythical creatures one would normally see the appearance of those characters in their mind while following the plot. In contrast, movie heroes on a TV screen are usually created for the viewer by directors and producers of the film. Watching TV substitutes the need to develop one’s own imagination because the characters and their surroundings are shown on the screen.Furthermore, it is argued that reading is the best way to expand one’s vocabulary. The reader learns the correct spelling of a word by seeing it printed in a book, and they grasp its meaning from the context, without having to look it up in a dictionary. Not only new words but also numerous sentence structures can be learnt from books. To take advantage of these benefits English teachers in many schools use English novels as teaching materials. Students are asked to read the story and capture the keywords to answer the questions in the exam. In comparison, learning new words while watching a TV show isn’t always easy because the viewer’s attention is drawn to the action on the screen and if there are no subtitles, the spelling of the words is not obvious. All this makes a book a more effective tool for a language learner compared to TV.In conclusion, I believe people who love to read tend to have a more active imagination and advanced linguistic comprehension than those who watch television, since readers are required to imagine the story in the book and learn the meaning of new words from the context.",8,True,90.3960979687194,338
"It is often thought by some people that wealth and material belongings are the measurement criteria of success. In my opinion, wealth is not the effective way to measure success as there are many other factors like good family relationship, health and dream career that make a person successful. It is undeniable that everyone in the world strives for happiness and hence, it should be the best way to measure success. Although some people have wealth which is enough to buy all material belongings they want they attempt self-murder. For instance, life is quite stressful in some developed countries compared to developing or even underdeveloped countries. Therefore, wealth cannot be regarded as the criteria of measuring success. There are several factors that contribute to making a person successful. Firstly, it is irrefutable that family support is of paramount importance throughout the journey of life. Good family not only brings happiness to our life but also helps us to share worries and thereby reduces stress. Secondly, getting a suitable career that matches a person’s area of interest is inevitable for leading a happy and consequently, a successful life. Career brightens a person’s self-esteem. If a person gets a dream job, it helps their career progression as well as job prospects. Finally, health is another obvious factor that is unavoidable for a successful life. Only if a person is healthy, he can work hard to gain success. To conclude, money is not the basics of success because a person is successful only if he leads a happy and contended life. For this, he should have a good family, health and a satisfying career.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"It is now quite common for young people to imitate the lifestyle of famous actors and sports personalities. In my opinion, this trend has both merits and demerits.  Celebrities are people who have achieved name and fame in their field. They worked hard to become what they are. Obviously, there are a lot of things that young people can learn from famous people. Perseverance is one of them. Successful sportspersons have put in years of hard work to gain international name and fame. Many of them hail from very ordinary backgrounds and yet they achieved stupendous success by virtue of their hard work. A young person following an eminent sports personality in all likelihood will get inspired by his idol and learn the value of hard work and perseverance. This, in turn, benefits his own life and career.  Famous actors and musicians all have similar stories to tell and are an inspiration for millions. Their success story inspires young people to script their own success stories. In addition, youngsters following celebrities in fashion or sports are more likely to become health conscious. For example, teenagers admiring Bollywood celebrities often aspire to have the six pack abs that their screen idols possess. This encourages them to work out and it benefits their health. On the flip side, celebrities have their own flaws and a youngster should never try to copy their lifestyle blindly. For example, many actors are famous for their lavish lifestyle. They spend enormously on garments, cars and other accessories. A teenager who wants these luxuries for himself will unwittingly invite trouble into his life. When he realizes that he cannot live the glam lifestyle he aspires for, he will become disappointed. Some of them may even get involved in criminal activities to fund their lavish lifestyles. In conclusion, when teenagers get inspired by celebrities, it can have both positive and negative impact on their lives. There are certainly a lot of things they can learn from famous people. However, they should never try to copy their lifestyle blindly. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate. ",9,True,97.29306145963358,360
"It is considered by many that subjects such as computer and science should be preferred to subjects such as music. Although computer and science are crucial subjects, in my opinion, they cannot replace music as it has its own importance. Firstly, music comes under the category of art and therefore, it cannot be compared with science. In other words, often music represents the culture and custom of a community which cannot be represented by other means. If music is replaced in schools with other subjects, newer generation will never be able to fully understand and connect with their community’s culture. For example, often a lot of traditional stories are told in the form of folk songs because the music in the folk songs helps the children to understand the situation and emotions of the story. Another point to consider before preferring subjects like computers to music is that every child has different interests. While some students may be interested in science, there will be many who are interested in music. Moreover, students will get to know about the music at a young age which will increase career options available to them. For instance, a lot of famous musicians discovered music as a subject in their school. Ultimately, they found value in music and chose it as their career path. In conclusion, music is as important as subjects like computer and science because it has cultural significance and helps people to understand emotions. While other subjects have good career opportunities, music also offers a career with money and fame. Hence, I think it will be unwise to replace music with other subjects.

"Recent decades have witnessed a burgeoning growth of numerous industries; therefore, recruiting the right person for the position is crucial to the development of enterprises. But how do we determine if a person is the best fit? Advocates of conventional recruitment methods opine that this candidate must have sufficient experience and qualifications needed for that job. Nevertheless, some people argue that candidates’ personal qualities cannot be ignored. In my view, both components are of equal importance.To begin with, the conventional approach of checking potential workers’ qualifications via their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, issued qualifications and certifications from authorised organisations is vital. Apparently, whenever we submit a job application, we are always required to attach a CV while a cover letter is optional. Without a decent qualification, even if that candidate’s personal characteristics are suitable, the enterprise will need to carry out lots of skill trainings eventually.On the other hand, occasionally during an interview some HR officers ignore the significance of assessing how candidates’ individual qualities can fit in the company. Employers should assess not only candidates’ qualifications but also their enabling skills, ethics and value propositions. The more an employee’s personal qualities fit in a company’s culture and values, the more he or she is motivated to contribute to that company’s vision. KPMG is a great example of evaluating candidates’ personal qualifications and skills by utilising a game-based assessment process, followed by a video interview. This methodology enables a comprehensive assessment, and is embraced by many companies nowadays.To summarise, employers should assess both personal characteristics and formal qualifications when recruiting people as each of these elements has its own vital contribution to make in talent-seeking enterprises.",8,True,106.67579412057222,275
"Music has always been a significant part of people’s lives. Many individuals believe that music is an ideal way to connect with people of various cultures and ages. I strongly agree with this view, and I will justify my opinion in the subsequent paragraphs with relevant examples. To begin with, many international musical shows attract crowds from different nations and provide them a platform to connect with each other. It helps visitors to understand the local culture by connecting with its citezens, and by taking part in musical events. For example, In India, Bollywood Musical events attract audience from many countries, and these tourists stay in India for months to learn more about Indian music. As a result, they become friends with locals. Therefore, it is evident that music can bring people of multiple cultures closer. Furthermore, there are certain types of music which are loved by people of all ages. This is because such music is a part of a family’s or community’s culture. To illustrate, Indian folk and classical music is an integral part of family functions, and it provides a platform in which children, youngsters, and adults, all come together to listen to it. It further helps them to connect with each other. Hence, if there is no music, it would be difficult for people of different age groups to connect with each other. In conclusion, music provides the best space to connect with individuals of various cultures and age groups through international, and folk musical programs.  Therefore, I firmly believe that music should be promoted in its all forms.",8,True,77.55890218543394,263
"Many people say that movies can now be seen on various smart devices without having to go to the cinema theatre; however, others still support going to the cinema in order to fully enjoy the movie. I strongly believe that nothing can beat the thrill of watching a movie in a cinema. On the one hand, countless people are finding themselves watching films on their smart phones and tablets as it is more convenient. Furthermore, watching a movie on a mobile device is a lot less expensive than going to the theatre. For instance, the availability of entertainment websites like Netflix and Amazon Prime enables movie lovers to see their favourite movies at any time and at any place.  On the other hand, none of the aforementioned benefits of watching a movie on a phone or tablet can replace the joy of watching it in a cinema. This is because only when a movie is watched in a cinema, the audience can enjoy its visual and sound effects in its entirety. Furthermore, the lack of distractions in a theatre makes the movie experience much more joyful. For example, according to a survey 80% of movie lovers prefer watching a night show in the cinema to staying indoors and watching it on their television or laptop.   For all of the above mentioned reasons, I strongly support the statement that seeing your favourite movie on the big screen in a cinema is more thrilling than watching it on tiny handheld screens. To conclude, watching a movie on a small device is certainly more convenient and cost effective; however, watching it on the big screen in a cinema is an altogether different and a whole lot more enjoyable experience. It is up to the movie lover to decide what suits them the best. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate. ",8,True,51.25203713001629,319
"Price is the first thing that many people consider when purchasing a product or service. While I do admit that it is essential to spend our money wisely, I believe that money should not always be the chief consideration. Price ought to be considered because it is indeed necessary to control our spending to avoid falling into the debt trap. In other words, before buying a product or service, we should identify whether it is a necessity or something optional. Even if it is a necessity, we should look at the price tag before placing the order. Sometimes it is possible that two products serving the exact same purpose are sold at different price tags. For example, a Samsung phone serves more or less the same purpose as an iPhone; yet there are countless people who spend inordinate amounts of money on the latter just because they are fascinated by that brand name. Such spending is never recommended, especially since it will land the buyer in serious debt. Therefore, however tempting it may look a consumer must not buy a luxury item on credit. By contrast, there are situations when price tags must be ignored completely. Health and medical related services and expenses fall into this category. The amount of money spent should never be a priority in these circumstances, as any delay in availing of the service may lead to a life-threatening situation. Furthermore, in the event that the required amount is more than what the patient could afford, they should still proceed by borrowing money from a friend or obtaining a loan. However, such situations are rare and in most cases price ought to be considered so that excessive spending is budgeted and debt is avoided. In conclusion, people should be careful about spending large sums of money on goods and services, unless it is a matter of life and death. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"According to Dalai Lama, the Buddhist monk famous all over the world, sleep is the best meditation. However, a lot of people just cannot seem to get enough sleep. This essay will discuss the main problems of not getting enough sleep and will also suggest solutions which can be taken to tackle this situation. To begin with, people who work in a fast-paced environment have a hectic schedule. They have various tasks that need to be completed in a stipulated amount of time, and this puts them under tremendous pressure. The major side effect / drawback of sleep deprivation is the lack of concentration. In other words, the person feels less motivated and focussed the following day and this further affects his performance at work. Secondly, the lack of sleep also causes numerous health ailments such as cardiac trouble, diabetes and obesity. In addition, sleep deprived people lack the energy to work out and thus lead a sedentary lifestyle. For instance, according to a recent survey by the ‘WHO’ almost thirty per cent of the people are prone to several health problems due to the lack of proper rest.  However, there are ways to tackle such problems. Firstly, one should make it a habit to exercise and do meditation daily. This is to say, people with sleep deprivation should ensure that they dedicate at least some time of their day for these activities. This will not only help them to sleep easily but also increase their concentration levels. Apart from that, substances that contain caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol should be avoided as it disrupts the regular sleeping pattern. For example, numerous studies have shown that people tend to stay awake if they smoke or consume too much caffeine. Lastly, one should get in touch with the doctor if he/she is unable to get proper sleep before the health further deteriorates.  To conclude, lack of sleep disrupts the brain’s ability to think properly and causes several health issues; however, reducing the intake of substances that cause sleep deprivation and increasing meditation can help an individual sleep peacefully.

"According to some people, teachers play a greater role than parents in the social and academic development of children. I do not quite agree with this view. In my opinion, parents and teachers are equally responsible for the progress and success of children. Teachers certainly play an important role in the development of children because students spend a great deal of time at school. Teachers not only teach; they also act as the guardians of their students. In addition to teaching alphabets and numerals, they impart crucial social education. For example, teachers teach students how to get along with others. They teach them to cooperate and compete with one another without hurting them. Since the school is a microcosm of the world, it is the best place to learn social skills and teachers make this easier by guiding children every step of the way. The role of parents is equally, if not more, important. Parents are the first people that the child comes into contact with. Actually, studies have shown that much of the brain development occurs before the age of three.  Teachers play little or no role during this period. Also, no one loves the children like their parents do. Teachers are guiding lights and protect children from bullying and other vices at school, but the affection that they get from their parents is the ultimate security they need. Also, children are more likely to imitate their parents than their teachers. Actually, by simply being a role model for their children, parents can shape their character and career to a great extent. Parents also play a role in ensuring that the atmosphere at home is conducive to learning. No matter how well the teacher teaches, if the home environment is not suitable for learning, the children will not progress. To conclude, there is no denying the fact that teachers help with the social and intellectual development of children. However, the argument that they have a greater role than parents does not hold much water because parents are the first and most important influence on children. Do you have an essay on this topic?

" Public libraries have always been the treasure house of knowledge and information. However, some people opine that they have become irrelevant. In my opinion, libraries have certainly lost some of their importance; however, this does not mean that they are no longer needed.  To begin with, the internet is ubiquitous; moreover, it is cost-effective and convenient in terms of one’s quest for knowledge. These days, if someone has access to an electronic device like computer or mobile phone, they can find an infinite amount of information on any topic in a fraction of seconds. Therefore, surfing the internet is a lot easier than visiting a library to get access to the books. Moreover, the internet offers up-to-date information on any topic on one’s mind. Thus, people who have access to the internet may not have to visit libraries.  Nevertheless, public libraries are the store house of many ancient yet valuable resources that cannot be found online or on websites. Furthermore, not everyone is fortunate enough to have round the clock internet connectivity. Also, there are plenty of research theses, articles and manuscripts that have never made their way to the internet. So, there is no possible way to find this information on any research websites; hence, paying a visit to the local library is the only way to get some insight into these resources. Secondly, in many developing countries, people are still struggling to meet both ends; the internet is still a luxury for them and the library is the only gateway to knowledge and information.  To conclude, undoubtedly, libraries have lost some of their significance. Yet, they are still very much needed because information stored in a library is authentic and reliable.

They travel mainly because of work related commitments and personal interests. While doing so, they explore different cultures of the people and could even choose where they want to live in the future. One of the main reasons why people travel is their job. Due to globalization, many companies want their employees to travel different locations to understand the country’s specific requirements of their business. Once they travel, they understand the business needs of the specific country and design systems for the local markets. People also travel for leisure. They want to enjoy their holidays and book a preplanned guided tour to a tourist destination like Mauritius and Hawai. Some countries offer great deals during the peak summer period to encourage people travel to their location. Travelling to different places could help people live their dreamed life. Commuting to various locations gives people an opportunity to visit different places and understand a variety of cultures. This could help them analyse how people live in different locations. As a result, people could get much impressed with a particular country or location. They would like to relocate permanently to that location and could plan to live there in the future. By doing so, they would attain utmost satisfaction and could lead their life as per their aspirations. To conclude, people travel often these days due to their official demands and leisure.

"Throughout the world, English is considered as a link language that enables speakers of different mother tongues to communicate with one another. Some people argue that in this age of globalization, English may get replaced by another prominent language. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, instead of shaking the prominence of English as a global language, globalization will only reinforce it. English has more speakers than any other language in the world. Actually, the majority of them speak English as a second language. This is a clear indication of its popularity outside of English speaking countries like the USA, the UK and Australia. No other language enjoys this kind of reach. Of course, languages like Mandarin and Hindi are gaining prominence because many businesses are moving to China and India. This, however, does not mean that Mandarin or Hindi will replace English. While it is true that these languages have a considerable number of speakers within their countries, they are almost never used outside. This is not the case with English. Another factor that bolsters the popularity of English is the fact that much of the scientific literature is written in English. In other words, anyone who wants to stay abreast of the developments in science and technology need to know English. In addition, the vast majority of websites on the internet are in English. That means people who have a working knowledge of English have access to an endless pool of information. That explains why even countries like China and Japan have started teaching English in schools. To conclude, English is the language of opportunity and communication. As trade and commerce increase between countries, other languages may also gain more speakers. However, the argument that they will replace English as the language of communication does not hold water in view of the points mentioned above.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Plastic bag usage is increasing at an alarming rate, and it is one of the main causes of land and sea pollution as people often dispose of them after one time use. I totally agree with the opinion that governments should gradually prohibit them from being used for shopping purposes. Firstly, plastic bags have a detrimental effect on the environment because they are non-biodegradable. This means that it may take hundreds of years for a plastic carrier to decompose into pieces. Therefore, when the bags are buried into the soil or thrown into the ocean and wild animals eat them, plastic will enter the food chain, causing major issues and even death when ingested. For example, a hungry turtle may mistake a transparent plastic bag for a jellyfish and eat it. If that happens repeatedly, it is likely that the turtle will choke on the plastic it cannot digest and die painfully. Besides, plastic bags consist of many toxic chemicals which will negatively impact the surroundings when they are burnt. These harmful by-products will be released into the air, resulting in the gradual development of deadly diseases like cancer when people inhale them too frequently. The chemicals may also affect the fertility of the soil. This is because the roots of these plants may not be able to penetrate through plastic particles to get nutrients from the soil. As a result, the growth of crops will slow down, leading to reduction in yield.  In conclusion, I am in favour of the contention that there should be regulations to ban the use of plastic because of the detrimental impacts it has on our environment.

"In many parts of the United States, teenagers cannot go outdoors without adult supervision during the late hours of the night due to the imposition of a ‘curfew’. In my opinion, this step robs them of their basic human right to move about freely and could even affect their confidence levels in adulthood.  To begin with, being able to go outdoors is a constitutional right of all humans guaranteed by the US constitution. Preventing young people from going out at night without a parent or guardian is a bit like stripping them of that basic right. Of course, being out at late hours can pose many threats to the safety of teens. However, stopping them from venturing out is hardly the solution to this problem. Instead parents and teachers should make children aware of the vicious crimes such as looting, rape, kidnapping and substance abuse that are prevalent during the night hours. When children are equipped with knowledge, they will be able to better safeguard themselves and can be safely outdoors at any hour of the day or the night.  Additionally, going out with an adult is not always a feasible option especially since many children have parents or caretakers who work late night. For instance, teenage children of doctors, nurses, paramedics and 24-hour store employees are usually alone at night. If these children want to go out at night, it is not always easy for them to find a familiar adult who can accompany them. This can put them in trouble if they have urgent errands to run or late night parties to attend. Even returning home alone from a friend’s or relative’s place at night can put them in trouble and such situations have to be avoided. To summarise, in my opinion, teenagers should be allowed to go outdoors at night. They should be empowered with knowledge and technology so as to safe-guard themselves from sticky situations. These steps will not only make them independent and confident but also give them the freedom to make their own choices in life.",9,True,78.57044887780549,342

"It is true that an increasing number of media houses use photographs to validate their news stories. While some people think photographs are not a vital source of information others opine that their role in disseminating news is indispensable. In my opinion using photographs in the news columns plays a very important role in stimulating interest among the readers and aids in easy understanding. On the one hand, some people think that photographs are not a valid source of news for the simple reason that they can be doctored. In this age of Photoshop and multimedia, there is no way we can be assured of the authenticity of images that we come across in newspapers and on the internet. In fact, there have been many instances when photos were morphed or edited to taint the reputation of some well-known people. A morphed image looks original but that is not the case. Countless celebrities and politicians have paid the price of fame by having their morphed images in compromising or unflattering positions published in glossies. Since photos look truer than words, they do considerable harm and it is not always possible for a tainted person to regain their reputation. Hence, the argument that photos are not a valid source of information certainly holds some water.  On the other hand, photos make the story livelier. They arouse the interest of the reader and make them want to read the whole story. Also, we can never dismiss the fact that photos capture the moments as they are and are an accurate representation of the event or the happening. Of course, they can be manipulated but in the absence of any manipulation, they are the ultimate truth. One has to admit that the vast majority of photos published in newspapers are genuine and provide a clear picture of the news story. In addition, readers are able to understand the news easily when the news stories are supported by photos. To conclude while it is true that people have different views I believe photographs in news stories are indispensable as they not only kindle the interest among the readers but also facilitate easy understanding of the news story.

"Nowadays, the increasing rate of crime is a cause for concern. Some people opine that a fight against poverty could help in reducing the crime rate, whereas others think that there are more effective ways to tackle this issue. In my opinion, in addition to reducing poverty, we need better police patrolling and stringent punishments to deal with crime. It is often thought that that poverty is the biggest cause behind the rising offenses. Often poor people get into the criminal world just to fulfill their basic needs. If employment is given to these people to help them survive, they can definitely be dissuaded from committing crime. Moreover, they will not get time to think over crime because they will be busy doing their jobs. Research shows that 80% of the criminals live below poverty line. They get involved in crime in the urge to get something for their families. Hence, offering a source of income to these people could reduce the crime rate. However, fighting poverty alone will not improve the situation. Not everyone who commits crime hails from a poor background. Some are hardcore criminals and they can only be reformed with punishment. Moreover, the fear of imprisonment could deter them from committing crime. Additionally, more police security will automatically create fear among the criminals and they will be scared of doing anything wrong in the presence of police. For example, in Delhi, just to give security to the female employees working in night shifts, the government has appointed more police force on roadsides to ensure their safety. In conclusion, tackling crime is not an easy task but the government can take proper actions to mitigate this issue. By creating more job opportunities for the poor people, increasing police patrolling and awarding stringent punishments for criminals, the government can reduce the crime rate to a great extent.

"Museums are often considered as a beautiful reflection of a country’s glorious past. As the internet can provide a gigantic treasure of information about a nation‘s history and culture, museums are being tagged as unnecessary these days. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, museums should be preserved as a sign of heritage since data on the internet cannot match the true essence of actual visual experience. To begin with, art galleries and museums house the cultural and traditional assets of any nation. Some of these are in the shape of sculptures; some are in the form of paintings. Several museums have preserved ancient things which are a sign of pride and prestige for the nation and its citizen. The information provided on the internet does not create the same amount of curiosity and inquisitiveness among people as the actual visualisation of these things at the museum. Therefore, rather than sidelining the requirement of conserving museums, these must be refurbished to garner the attention of maximum people. Concomitantly, museums are places of tourist attraction. These places fascinate locals as well as foreign tourists alike. Although museums have nominal entry fees, still it contributes to the revenue of a nation, eventually, giving an economic boost to a country. This will be affected if people are encouraged to view information about culture and history online. In addition to that, information on the internet can sometimes be dubious as there are a number of unauthentic sites and it becomes tough to keep a check on what is being uploaded online. Any incorrect story can seriously impact the country’s reputation; hence, efforts must be made to save the integrity of museums. To conclude, a nation’s historical and cultural treasures abound in museums and art galleries; therefore, these must be maintained and any knowledge available online should be only for reference purposes.

"Sports, by nature, involve intense competition and people often debate the factors which determine the outcome of a sports match. Some hold the opinion that supreme physical strength enables one to win, while others believe that only those who possess a winning attitude can be successful. In my opinion, physical abilities are as important as the right mindset. On the one hand, superior strength gives athletes an edge over their peers when it comes to physical confrontation. For example, in a sport like football, players have to physically confront their competitors, and hence those who demonstrate greater physical strength are more likely to win / succeed. Boxing is another game that requires immense physical strength and endurance. A stronger boxer naturally has faster punching speed and higher punching power, which enable them to easily knock down their rivals. Physical strength also imparts higher levels of endurance which is essential for athletes to maintain their performance for a long time. This is important in almost all games because players who get tired easily cannot achieve much regardless of their talent.  On the other hand, a winning mindset is also of great importance. To be specific, in a fierce competition, the player who is falling behind will have high levels of stress. If they cannot maintain the positive attitude, the immense pressure will overtake their natural ability to perform and they will lose even if they possess excellent stamina. This is because our mind controls our body and once the mind accepts defeat, the body can achieve hardly anything.  In conclusion, fitness and spirit both play significant roles in ensuring success in sports. A strong body improves an athlete’s ability to confront physically, while an optimistic mindset and intense craving for success ultimately enable them to win. ",9,True,105.17094326167603,294
"According to some people, children should be allowed to decide what they should eat, wear or watch. However, others opine that if children have the freedom to make their own choices, they will grow up into selfish individuals. In my opinion, children should definitely have the liberty to make their own decisions; however, since they are too young to understand what is good or bad for them, parents should help them make the right decisions.  It is important for a child to learn how to make decisions regarding his lifestyle or future career as decision making is an important skill for success in life. When he is allowed to make his own choices he will learn to take the responsibility for his actions. This is another skill required for success. Needless to say, a child who takes small decisions right from his childhood can deal with the conflicts and challenges in life more efficiently.  On the contrary, when children have total freedom to make their own choices, they may fail to consider the feelings of others. For example, a child may insist that he should be able to watch cartoon whenever he wants to. He may not consider what other members of the family want to watch on TV. If his parents allow him to have his way all the way, he will definitely grow into a selfish person who does not care for others. It is, therefore, important for parents to set the limits of the freedom their children can have.  In conclusion, I believe that even though children should be allowed to make their own choices, parents should teach them to respect the feelings of others; otherwise, they may end up becoming selfish.

"Although it is sometimes thought by many people that a foreign language is only used when they travel or work in a different country, other people have a contrasting view as they think that there are much more benefits to learning a second language. In my opinion, a person can gain a lot if they know how to communicate in a foreign language. On the other hand, some people think that they should learn a foreign language only if they decide / choose to live in a foreign country. Of course, knowledge of a foreign language is beneficial in such situations because this enables the visitor / migrant to communicate more effectively when they are abroad. For instance, someone travelling to China for work from a non-Chinese speaking state must know how to interact with locals and co-workers. Furthermore, knowing their language will make them feel comfortable at a stranger place. However, in my opinion, the reasons for learning a non-native language should not be limited to work or travel purposes as a lot more can be achieved by mastering a foreign language.  Firstly, knowing a second / foreign language will enable someone to understand the diverse culture and the traditional aspects of the country where it is the mother tongue. For example, the language is considered as a gateway to a nation’s culture and traditions. Secondly, many studies have shown that children who can speak a second or third language have far better cognitive development than children who can speak only one language. Finally, knowing a different language can also enable people to read more books or content available over the internet and socialise with people without travelling to that country. To conclude, people may have different opinions, but I believe that the benefits of learning a foreign language are not limited to work or travel. Acquisition of a foreign language helps with brain development. It also opens the door to a culture and civilization.

"In recent years, with the improvement in healthcare sector and better , people are able to live longer and contribute to the economic progress of a nation more, compared to the past. Some see this as an entirely positive development, while others point out the drawbacks of working beyond the retirement age.Delaying retirement enables individuals to actively contribute to the society. On a personal level, working past retirement age provides an avenue for individuals to remain not only physically but also mentally active. Moreover, this option empowers the ageing population to be financially independent and economically self-sustainable past retirement age. In countries with growing ageing population such as Singapore, for instance, citizens are given an option to work beyond their retirement age based on the demands of their job and their capability to handle these tasks. Hence, working beyond retirement age empowers workers, ensures economic progression of the nation, and alleviates the challenges faced by an ageing population.On the flip side, working beyond the retirement age may result in adverse health impacts on workers and a decrease in productivity levels. In Japan, the suicide rates have recently been increasing due to rising stress levels at work faced by the ageing population who are pushed to work beyond their optimal capacity. Escalating stress levels from work  to various health complications putting a strain on the healthcare system. Hence, working beyond retirement age may worsen the overall welfare of individuals and adversely impact the economy.To sum up, though working beyond retirement age  health hazards leading to reduction in productivity levels, it seems to me that the benefits far outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, by assessing the capability of individuals and tailoring their jobs to their health profile, firms and companies should actively involve their workers to be productive beyond their retirement age.",8,True,69.13729391699829,300
"It is undeniable that a large number of people spend their leisure time doing unproductive things like watching TV. The following paragraphs will discuss why this is happening and whether this is a positive or negative development. There are a wide number of reasons why individuals tend to see movies or serials in their free time. First and foremost, movies are easily accessible now. Unlike in the past, it is not necessary that we have to go to the theatre to watch a latest release. These days with internet or movie libraries we can borrow CDs and watch them immediately. Secondly, the worldwide media provides apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc at a very cheaper price. They have all the latest movies and episodes available all the time. As a result, many people are addicted to this and end up spending time watching these on their TVs or smart phones. Watching TV is a passive way to spend time and it leads to less social interaction. More screen time has negative effects on both adults and children. As for children, they might have speech and language problems, attention deficits and so on whereas adults are so engrossed in the movies that they don’t spend enough time with family or have face to face communication with them. Moreover, most of the individuals do not have any hobbies like gardening, knitting and so on as they do not spend time for it and instead spend time watching TV. To conclude, I personally feel that spending a lot of time watching movies has an overall negative impact on people as it is an unproductive activity. Hence, screen time should be reduced and leisure time should be used for better purposes.  Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"According to some people it is pivotal to emphasize on the protection of animal species that are under extinction: however, others disagree. In their opinion, issues of human beings ought to be given more priority. This essay will discuss why I think that both the problems need to be treated with utmost importance. On the one hand, some people maintain the view that attention should be given to the rising issues of animal extinction. The primary reason is that animals are an integral part of the ecosystem. When many different species of animals go extinct, the repercussions will be felt across the planet. Extinction of wildlife will disrupt the food chain and it is only a matter of time before humans find themselves in trouble. What’s more, animals also own the planet and they have the right to exist here just like us humans. Killing them for our benefits and engaging in activities that make their existence difficult is not only unethical but also dangerous.  On the other hand, problems faced by humans also need to be addressed. The truth is that a large section of humanity still lives in poverty and ill health. It is important to uplift them and a great deal of funding is essential to achieve this. Obviously, there is a limit to the amount of money governments can use for wildlife conservation. In conclusion, every creature on earth deserves equal right to survive and it is possible only when they live in co operation with each other. Hence, I think that efforts should be made to protect all species that face the threat of extinction but it should not be at the expense of human welfare and needs.

"The type of school plays a pivotal role in moulding the career / character of children. A few individuals believe that single sex school is ideal for any given child, while others opine that co-educational schools have an upper hand over the other. I concur with the second set of audience and the same is discoursed in this composition.  It is observed that students from single sex school are often shy and introvert compared to others, particularly while interacting with members of the opposite sex. This is mainly because of their limited exposure and communication with the other sex at their juvenile age. As a result, adolescents often find it very challenging to adapt to the corporate environment where both men and women work. This makes them feel awkward at the workplace. Moreover, they might also feel left out and isolated in their workplace, which in turn affects their performance and job satisfaction.  On the other hand, students studying in co-educational schools are often bustling with self confidence and are usually extrovert in nature. Third is because of the gender neutral arena in which they are nurtured during their academics. Additionally, co-educational institutes are equipped with additional soft skill courses like moral science, which aids in inculcating basic civic ethics like gender equality and respect for opposite sex. Such skill sets are highly appreciated especially in hospitality industries like hotels and aviation and thus they widen their scope and job opportunities. A contemplated survey published by a renowned newspaper shows that a co-educated student had 20% higher chances of getting campus placement than a student who studied in a same sex school.  All in all, co-educational schools equip students with all the social and interpersonal skills they need for success in their personal and professional life. Hence, in my opinion, it is better to send children to mixed gender schools. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"Some say that young and energetic employees are the most valuable for the company; others argue that older employees have more experience and knowledge. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your opinion and examples, based on you own experience. Response Today the employment scenario, the world over, is more diverse than ever. Along with people from different origins and different genders, young and elderly people also make the workforce very diverse. So the debate as who bring more value to business , the your or the old employees, is quite obvious. It is quite natural that young blood brings fresh ideas and hence leads innovations. Today innovations are one of the most required elements of any business. Many a times young people bring novelty in the way business is being done. It is also important to note that the new breed is more flexible, adaptable and less resistant in any business environment. Last but not the least, during the early phase of their career they are less expensive than the elderly people in the workforce. All of these reasons make us to believe that young force is the most desirable for any business. However, any business needs experience and knowledge. The old generation brings the required knowledge because of their vast experience of industry. This generation have seen cycles of ups and downs of a business during their career. They understand the nuances of their industry and can even foresee a trend. This ability is an asset to any business. So the older employees are invaluable to any company and they are the guides for the young ones. Pondering on both sides of argument, I am of the opinion that young and old, both types of employees are required for any business.

"Plastic carry bags form a major chunk of garbage in most countries. They pose a great threat to the environment. Therefore, there is a general consensus that there must be a legal ban on these items. I completely agree with this view. To begin with, over the last few decades there has been a dramatic increase in the use of plastic bags. They are used everywhere from grocery shops to shopping malls. Most of the times, these bags are not properly disposed. This has led to the contamination of land and water bodies. Furthermore, these plastic wastes are non-biodegradable; hence they remain in the environment for an indefinite period of time. They also pose a great risk to all the animals and fishes that might feed on them. Overall, plastic is a source of hazard for the ecosystem. Plastic is a versatile material and that is the reason for its popularity. It is cheap and lightweight. It can be used to package a variety of items including liquids. The only way to reduce the use of plastic carry bags is to enforce a strict ban on them. For instance, many cities in India have already prohibited the use of plastic carry bags. This forces people to turn to alternative materials such as bio-degradable or jute bags. This wouldn’t have happened unless stringent laws were passed. Therefore, plastic ban by law is inevitable. In conclusion, plastic wastes are accumulating all around the globe and posing a great threat to the flora and fauna. However, this vexing problem can be controlled by placing a legal ban on plastic bags. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Automobiles have played an important role in the progress of the human society. Some people believe that it would have been better if they were not invented. I do not agree with this view. In my opinion, cars have done more good than harm and it is impossible to even imagine a life without them. Even so, it is important for us to limit the use of private cars. The world has become a village due to the invention and subsequent evolution of the automobile industry. Today we can travel to distant places in a short span of time. Actually, journeys that used to take weeks or months in the past can now be completed within hours or days. Cars have also made our journey more comfortable. Rain or shine if we have a car we can go anywhere whenever we want. This can be quite liberating. The invention of the car has also enabled people living in remote areas to pursue work or studies in cities. The primary advantage of cars is that they can reach places that are not accessible by buses or trains. And in emergency situations, they can become lifesavers. Of course, automobiles pollute and that is the main downside of them. This, however, does not mean that they need not have been invented. Actually, we can control pollution by limiting the use of cars and also by taking measures such as carpooling. In addition, we should use public transport whenever possible. We should also adopt technologies like electric cars. Since they do not emit harmful gases, they have little impact on the planet.

"It is often believed that a uniform helps create a disciplined atmosphere at school. I agree with this view. In my opinion, students should be required to wear uniform because of the many benefits offered by it. There are many reasons why uniform is important in schools. Firstly, it creates a positive environment in schools; consequently, the decorum of school is maintained efficiently as poor children are not bullied on the basis of their clothes. This also eradicates any disparity between rich and poor students. Thus, a happy environment is created. Another point is that the uniform enables children to concentrate more on studies rather than on their wardrobe. When they do not have to worry about what to wear to school, they can work to achieve their goals. Moreover, parents’ hard earned money is saved as children are supposed to abide by uniforms. For instance, many parents are happy to send their children to schools where uniform is compulsory. Nevertheless, despite the benefits, there are certain minor drawbacks. For instance, standard size uniforms may not be comfortable for obese children. However, those children can get their uniform stitched by a tailor. Another minor issue is that students may get tired of wearing the same piece of clothing every day; however, this problem can be resolved by having different uniforms on different days. In conclusion, uniform makes it easy to maintain discipline at school and create an atmosphere of equality. Enforcing a rule that requires students to abide by a dress code has more advantages than disadvantages. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Some parents, especially those who are known as helicopter parents, believe that children should always follow their instructions. However, others have a contrasting view. In their opinion, children should be encouraged to think and act independently. I agree with the latter opinion.  Parents who want to have strict control over their children believe that it is the best way of parenting. There are certainly some positive aspects to this style of parenting. To start with, children can benefit from the immense experience of their parents. Since parents know better than children, in most situations they will be able to make more informed decisions. However, there are also some downsides to this approach. For one thing, times have changed. The challenges that our kids face today are entirely different from what we faced when we were their age. As a result, the assumption that parents can always make the right decisions does not hold much water in the current scenario. By contrast, if children are encouraged to think independently, they develop confidence which will stand them in good stead when they grow up. For example, children with independent thinking skills would prefer to work out a solution rather than ask other people for help when they are confronted with a problem. On the other hand, children who are used to getting told what to do are reluctant to take initiatives and when they meet difficulties at work or life, their first reaction is to ask their parents for help. Obviously, it is not difficult to see which of these two types of kids will become successful later in life. In conclusion, compared to children who are always told what to do, children who think and act independently have better problem solving skills and confidence which will benefit them immensely when they face problems in life. Hence, I believe that children should be encouraged to think for themselves. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"It is argued that everyone should have free access to university education. I agree with this. I believe that students who opt to continue in the university should not be burdened with their tuition fees because not all students have the means to pay for school and, it is one of the obligations of the government to provide education to students. Not every student who aspires to pursue higher education can afford the tuition fee. Many students who deserve to be sent to the university belong to poor families who are struggling to support their daily living. If paying for tuition is a requirement for every student to enter college then, those individuals who deserve and have the capability to be a university student will be denied of this opportunity. If a student from a developing country is not allowed to enter university due to lack of resources, he will lose his opportunity to bail his family out of poverty. Moreover, the government should be responsible for the education of its residents. It should be the government’s priority to ensure that students who have the desire to continue and obtain a college degree will be granted a scholarship. In the long run, free university education will benefit not only the individual but also the community / country. A great example is the government scholars in the Philippines. This scholarship program enables high school students to be granted a free university education provided that they stay and serve their own country for a minimum of two years. This move of the government helped both the scholars’ family and the country at the same time. In conclusion, provision of free education to students who have the desire to pursue higher studies should be implemented because it is the government’s responsibility to help students obtain a degree and it will ease the burden on the family of those who really want to continue their studies.

Multiple reasons can be attributed to the popular belief that music reduces the cultural differences and creates a friendly bonding. Firstly, a vast majority of the world’s population love music.

Under these circumstances, music has only a meager role in strengthening relationships. Apart from this, there are numerous problems which are created by the improper use of music. It adds up to noise pollution when played at high volumes. Furthermore, youngsters get addicted to it very soon and have reduced focus on academics.

There are numerous positive aspects to studying in a foreign country, such as the discovery of new cultures, the possibility of learning more about oneself and the chance of learning a new language.By travelling to a foreign country, it is certain that one will be confronted with foreign customs and traditions. Experiencing and understanding these customs and their origins provides students with an interesting chance to develop a more open-minded attitude towards others. Additionally, it is also extremely stimulating to learn more about the reasons behind certain traditions and practices.A prime reason for students studying abroad is the prospect of finding oneself and growing as an individual. When living in a foreign country, students have to become increasingly independent and they are confronted with their strengths and weaknesses. Typically students develop increased self-esteem and also acquire or improve upon their skills of housekeeping and cooking, which are important for living independently later on in life.When living in a foreign country students are exposed to a new language and in most cases attempt to learn it. If they already possess some knowledge about the language, they have the possibility of advancing and improving upon these skills with the native population. The ability to speak multiple languages offers students a higher chance of being successful on the international job market, which makes studying abroad an attractive choice.Personally, I would like to study abroad in either Scotland or France, because I would like to experience the life and customs in these countries.

"A few parents believe in buying too many toys for their children to play with. This practice has a great influence on the intellectual growth of the child. Some of the effects of having several toys prove to be beneficial whereas others prove to be harmful.  Children having many toys usually have greater levels of confidence and emotional satisfaction due to various reasons. Firstly, toys help in the development of young inquisitive minds. Consequently, the creative and reasoning skills are boosted when they play with their toys. Additionally, the toy market is booming with educational toys for all age-groups of school-going children. These toys help in the improvement of academic performance of the children as their design is based upon the popular learning paradigm “learn with play”. However, a number of drawbacks are associated with this practice of purchasing more and more toys for children. Firstly, children become more demanding and stubborn. They start believing that the parents are obliged to buy them every new toy in the market. Parents may face considerable financial distress due to the never ending demands of their children. Secondly, children start cherishing the ownership of the toys rather than using them to learn new skills. Lastly, children outgrow the toys pretty fast and then they become useless. This results in an increase in the amount of trash at home and adds up to the pollution upon discarding. Hence it also proves to be hazardous to the environment. In conclusion, I feel that toys help in the mental growth of the child making them happy and contended. However, the purchase of new toys should be done in a restricted way owing to the repercussions they have for the growing children. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"While some people argue that politicians have the utmost impact on the universe, I am of the opinion that scientists are the most influential people on earth. This essay will discuss both sides of the argument in more detail. To begin with, some people believe that politicians have the greatest impact on the planet. This is because they make laws, policies and regulations that can last forever and can directly affect our lives either positively or negatively. For example, it was not possible to reach the Paris agreement on climate change without the participation of politicians. As a result, countries from across the globe came together and agreed to reduce the global temperature by two degree Celsius by 2050 which will have a sustainable impact on our lives. So, this argument is understandable. However, I maintain that scientists have the biggest impact on our planet. Without them it was not possible to make our lives more convenient. Because of them, there are now cures for different kinds of diseases, we can easily communicate with other people across the globe and we are able to know problems that are affecting our world such as the climate change. For instance, the invention of Penicillin which was invented in 1940s and was considered the greatest invention of all time, has saved millions of lives from dying and it is still very effective in fighting different kinds of infections. In addition, scientists are more popular and more trustworthy than politicians across the globe because it is commonly understood that while politicians work to benefit themselves, scientists are more concerned about our lives in general. To sum up, while I understand the argument that politicians have the biggest impact on the world, I strongly believe that scientists are the ones who have the highest influence  on our planet. The facts that they have invented many useful things to the world and they are more popular and more honest than politicians are the reasons for my argument.",7,True,74.25,330
"Some people do not have homes to live in most parts of the world. According to some, donating money to the homeless is the best option one can choose to help them. I certainly disagree with this viewpoint as it makes them lazy and also there is a chance that the funds will be misused. Providing monetary help to the homeless people will make them dependent and lazy. People take this as an opportunity to earn easy money instead of finding ways to earn legitimately. Hence it is better to provide work to the homeless so that they can earn money to build a home. For instance, the Telangana state government provided employment opportunities to the villages without homes. Moreover it helped them to get bank loans to build their home. This is an innovative idea by the government which benefits the people with homes as well as jobs. On the other hand, there is a chance of fund diversion if people are helped with money. Most of the homeless are unemployed and may have different necessities other than a house. So, they may end up using this money for other purposes. For example, most of the people who live in the slums do not have enough money to spend on their daily needs. Any money given to these people will be spent on their primary needs such as food and clothing. Hence, giving them money to build homes is not advisable. In conclusion, I strongly disagree with the idea of giving money to the homeless as this money will not be utilized for building homes. Moreover, it will also make them dependent on easy money options.",7,True,61.47354656317106,277
"Education has become one of the most important aspects in the modern societies. Some people believe that university education is mandatory for the youth while others argue that university graduates have a higher percentage of unemployment. I believe that both opinions are partially correct as I will support my stand with valid arguments in this essay. The world is now dependent on sophisticated technologies and supporters of higher education argue that in order to operate and utilize modern tools and technologies, we need more skilled and higher educated employees. In addition, it is not possible to develop new innovations and breakthroughs if the employees are not educated. Take, for example, companies working in communication industry require at least bachelor degree in engineering for technical jobs and in some cases the entry-level requirement is M.Sc. or PhD. Indeed, if the youth are university-graduates, they will have a better opportunity to get hired. Thus, it has become imperative that every person should have a university degree. On the other hand, some people contend that university curriculum never educate students how to work in the real world, as they focus more on the theoretical side. Because of this, most university students do not have practical skills that match job market requirements. Consequently, unemployment rates of university-educated people are, in some cases, much higher than those of people with lower education levels. For instance, in Egypt, people who have a vocational training will have tremendous opportunities to work, while highly-educated people may suffer from unemployment. That clearly shows that the gap between the university education and the market needs can deter people from joining colleges in order to have higher number of employment opportunities. Hence, I believe that the education systems should be continuously upgraded and enhanced to minimize this gap and meet the market requirements. To conclude, many employers insist on university education. Meanwhile, the lack of the practical knowledge in the current curriculums reduces the opportunity of fresh-graduates to get jobs. Therefore, I believe that continuous improvement of the education system would resolve this situation and encourage more people to get enrolled in universities.",7,True,88.0,352
"You should spend about 40 minutes on this essay writing task and write at least 250 words. The amount of rubbish producing by average household has raised dramatically in the last few decades. This essay considering the reasons for this negative trend and suggests some ways how this problem could be solved. Growing standard of living and new technologies changed the way we treat the food. A couple of decades ago one could be surprised by seeing every single fruit packed to its own wrapping in a supermarket. Now it is not the case. The breakthrough in chemical technology made plastic production fairly cheap. It also changed people habit. Now, when one feels thirsty he just buys a plastic bottle of water without thinking about the future of empty bottle. A short while ago we used textile bags to carry purchases from a shop, but today everybody relies on plastic bags providing for free. Several measures could be undertaken by governments in order to reduce the amount of trash. The main one is a restriction of plastic production. For example, they can forbid free bags in supermarkets. Also, it is possible to increase taxes for plastic bottles vendors and encourage deposit return system. In addition, it is important to tell school children about responsible consuming and about the impact rubbish has to nature. To conclude, growing economy force people to consume more and, as a consequence, to produce more wastes.

"Technology is growing by leaps and bounds; every day there is a new innovation that revolutionizes our way of living. There is a general notion that one day technology will help to solve all the problems related to the environment  However, in my opinion technology can only guide us or predict the future and all the precautions have to be taken by humans in order to save the environment.  The major problem faced by mankind today is the scarcity of water resources especially the water that is fit for human consumption. Technology can only help purify the water with the help of water filter and other latest technologies. However, it is we who have to use the water judiciously and conserve it in order to make it available for our coming generations. In other words technology can only assist us and ultimately the onus is on us to act.   The other prominent environmental issue nowadays is pollution. Technology is the main factor behind the increase in the level of pollution. For example, the advancement in motor vehicle technology has made it possible for each one of us to afford a car or bike, which in turn has led to sharp increase in air pollution level due to vehicular exhaust. While technology is causing the pollution humans can reduce it by limiting the use of vehicles, planting more trees and making technology more nature friendly. To conclude, no doubt technology can help us to tackle environmental issues; however, it cannot magically solve all the problems plaguing the planet. Only humans can solve environmental issues caused by human activity. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate. ",8,True,58.8624203821656,287
"There is no denying the fact that the sales of the fashionable clothes have risen dramatically in the last few years. The positive side of this trend is eclipsed by its negative aspects. This essay will analyse both the aspects in the following paragraphs. It is argued that wearing branded clothes enhances the self confidence of an individual. This notion was championed by a survey done by a leading magazine. According to it, people who wore fashionable clothes on the day of the interview did better than those who wore regular attire. Furthermore, it is believed that wearing trendy attire enhances the personality of the individual. This, in turn, improves his self esteem and he may even win the respect/admiration of his colleagues / friends. However, this positive side of having branded apparel is overshadowed by its negative aspects. First and foremost, clothes endorsed by celebrities are usually very expensive. Consequently, the obsession with wearing branded costumes may hurt the financial health of a middle class family. Secondly, fashion trends are ephemeral, lasting at the most one season. This casts doubt on the long term utility of these clothes. Hence, wastage of dresses is a huge concern. Last but not least, there are serious aspersions on the quality of clothing material as they are meant for short term usage. Therefore, it is evident that negative aspects of buying fashionable clothes dominate its few positive effects. To conclude, it is clear that fashionable clothes are more of a luxury than a necessity. Performance in any walk of life should not depend upon the type of clothes one wears; rather it should depend on one’s intellect and education. Therefore, it is reasonable to state that negative aspects of following fashion trends outweigh its positive side.",8,True,76.28588807785889,292
"Some people opine that children should spend their free time playing team sports or other group activities. Others counter / oppose this view. According to them, children should find a way to keep themselves engaged on their own. Both views will be discussed in this essay before arriving at a conclusion. These days some parents want their kids to socialise and in their free time they have them join some group activities. Generally speaking, these kinds of activities can be some kind of dance classes, group discussions, robotic classes and sports which help them to learn important skills like coordination and cooperation. This prepares them for the future because they already know how to work with a group of people and have good team skills / spirit. Both qualities are essential for success at the workplace. There are also parents who prefer to leave the children on their own, meaning they can do whatever they like to do. This can have both pros and cons. As for the advantages, it helps them to develop on their own and makes them more independent.  Children will also learn to work independently and this skill will be beneficial in those phases of life when they have to take decisions on their own. On the flip side, if children are left alone, they may become aloof and that is not good at all. Such children may also get into bad or anti-social activities. For example, the notorious game Blue Whale primarily targets lonely children and many kids who play this game eventually commit suicide. Also some children may lack confidence if they spend their free time all by themselves. To conclude, in my opinion / I think, we should get our children involved in group activities which keep them busy and give them an opportunity to learn from other kids.",8,True,98.86739864864865,303
"In a little over a decade, the meaning of parenting for some people has changed the world over. While some people feel that parents should supervise the activities of their children, others think they should not. In my opinion, they should. Let us delve deeper into both the given schools of thought with my own perspective, in the subsequent paragraphs.  On the one hand, it could be argued that children should be provided with a sense of freedom. First and foremost, this is essential for children to grow into responsible adults. To elaborate, if parents provide total freedom to their children, not only will they learn to think independently, but they will also perform their day to day tasks without help.  In addition, providing young ones freedom can help them to express themselves well. In other words, as children have the freedom of thought, they will be able to live their life true to their beliefs. To cite an example, Dr. Sigmund Freud, the eminent psychoanalyst in his study on human behaviour and cognitive skills has asserted that children who had experienced more freedom in their formative period could express their feelings better than the others.  However, I side with those who believe that parents should always supervise their little ones. Primarily, by monitoring / watching over their activities, parents can keep track of their day to day life. To clarify, childhood is a formative period for children. If parents do not oversee / supervise their activities, their kids may fall into bad company. Moreover, supervising their young ones is a great way for parents to inculcate moral values in them. To substantiate, as children need love, affection and understanding, supervising them closely enables parents to develop these qualities in them. Furthermore, if parents look after their children’s activities, it will help to build intimate relations between them. To explicate, parents and children could understand each other’s feelings more because parents build a strong relation with children by offering their time to them. To illustrate, a survey conducted by UNICEF in 2018 in the US, on a group of 500 children, ranging between 8-15 years revealed that 85% of them showed deeper relationship with their parents who spent more time supervising their activities. To encapsulate, although it is undeniable that providing children with more freedom helps them to express themselves better, parents can stop them from going astray by supervising them closely. Therefore, on balance, I believe that parents should monitor the activities of their children.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Movies are a good source of entertainment that helps in rejuvenating individuals. While some people believe that a film can be watched on personal devices such as phones or tablets, others argue that theatre is the best place to watch it. In my opinion, watching movies on personal gadgets is convenient as well as cost-effective. On the one hand, movies can be watched on electronic gadgets such as laptops and mobile phones. I prefer this as it is a convenient source of entertainment. The advent of smart phones and advancement in Internet technology have allowed us to keep ourselves entertained anywhere. Consequently, it provides freedom to watch movies or favorite TV shows while commuting to work. Moreover, the OTT platforms such as Netflix and Amazon prime are extremely cost-effective. For instance, the one-month subscription cost of Netflix is lower than the ticket price of one movie for a family. The content on these platforms are in abundance quantity which allows individuals to pick and choose the best to entertain themselves. Additionally, the streaming channels provide flexibility to pause and play the movie at our convenience. On the other hand, most of the theatres are equipped with Dolby digital technology that provides astounding sound quality which enthralls movie buffs. For instance, movies like Star-Wars can only be enjoyed thoroughly on a big screen which has captivating sound-effects. Furthermore, movies are made in 3-D technology these days which can only be watched in cinema halls. For example- movies like Avatar had amazing graphics that mesmerized audience and it can only be enjoyed on a big screen. In addition to that, watching cinema together with family in theatre is a nice way to relax and spend some quality time with near and dear ones. In conclusion, watching movies in a cinema is certainly the best way to enjoy them; however, I prefer watching them on my mobile devices because it is more convenient and less expensive.",8,True,72.72449447213152,323
"Writing product reviews on the internet is the latest trend among online users. People like to share their experience of the product with the world. In my opinion, this is absolutely a positive advancement as people can have a better idea of the product before buying it. This essay will discuss why writing reviews on social media is a good trend. Later, this essay will also enumerate the benefits online reviews bring to new customers. We are living in a world where people buy new things based on the ratings and comments provided by people who have already bought it. Many organizations provide services and in return ask for good feedback about them from the customers as this can boost their business. Many consumers have benefitted from these reviews as they can get to know the quality of the product before buying it. Sometimes they can also get a better price offer via these comments. These days, people are specifically looking for reviews before buying commercial goods. As these goods are costly and cannot be returned back, the consumers want to be doubly sure of the product they are buying and online reviews come to their rescue. Nowadays, reviews are not limited to products but people are rating their experiences as well. For a person who likes to travel and try new cuisines, there are abundant applications which will pay them for giving genuine comments about their travel. For example, in India, there are companies such as Zomato and Food panda which allow the users to rate the restaurants based on their experience. This has proved to be very beneficial for many other people who want to know about the place and are looking for sincere feedbacks. Many other giant companies such as Amazon and Walmart have a dedicated section on their website for customer reviews. These boards provide real guidance for the newcomers. Another benefit is that many organizations are hiring good content writers for their product and they are often keen to know how much active a person is on these platforms. In conclusion, in my view, there isn’t any negative side to this. Of course, sometimes the reviews and comments could be deceptive but in most of the cases, these have a positive impact on the customers. Having said that one should not totally rely on these reviews. It should be the user’s responsibility to do research beforehand so that they can avoid unpleasant surprises later.

"It is often argued that in order to provide opportunities for the young generation, senior employees should be encouraged to quit their job at the age of 55. I can agree with this argument only to a certain extent. Senior employees who feel that they are done with their job and are financially strong enough to manage the rest of their life must be prompted to take retirement. This allows them to relax during their twilight years. Many companies already offer a voluntary retirement scheme for exhausted employees. Energetic and talented youngsters will eventually replace them and that looks like a promising solution. However, a company may face some problems if senior employees leave. As senior employees are a treasure house of knowledge and experience, a company cannot allow all of them to leave early. There is no doubt in it that creative and innovative young minds can rejuvenate a company but without the guidance of senior employees, their efforts may not succeed. So to harness the insurmountable energy of young employees, a company seriously needs the mature and stable mind of seniors. Let’s take the example of Bill gates. Although he has been working for many years, he still rules the computer industry because of the exposure and knowledge he has acquired over the years. Without his guidance, Microsoft cannot remain the number one software company. In conclusion, after mulling over the whole issue, I believe that forcing seniors to retire when they are not ready for it is unjust on many grounds. I am quite sure that when I am 55 and above I will still be able to add value to my company. However, those who want to leave should be able to do so and still enjoy all the retirement benefits.",5,True,77.27869429092937,293
"Modern people are living a fast-paced life and many of them desire to finish things promptly. I attribute this phenomenon to the advancement of information technology including the internet. In my opinion, it can be positive and negative at the same time. The information technology has revolutionized every part of people’s life. It has changed almost every practice. Every service has become much more accessible and prompter in both businesses and individual’s daily life.  This can be exemplified by one trivial thing. People used to line up in the long queue to purchase tickets for movies in the past; however, this is not a conceivable case in the present. People book tickets in advance from home through online stores. They can even choose the seats. They can enjoy the movie on the reserved day without waiting. This means that film industry promotes sales by dealing with many customers within the limited amount of time and individuals consume this service with a few clicks away. As a result, people as a service provider or as a service user have become accustomed to immediate response. While the technology has been playing a leading role in making services instantly available, there are both boons and pitfalls associated with this. The primary merit stemming from it is that it has boosted productivity remarkably. Through programs set up in a systematic way, businesses can handle more deals at one time and consumers can secure their own service in a quick order with reduced time and efforts. Both sides have had benefits from this feature.  However, some people are dependent on the technology so much so that they have become impatient. When they have to wait for a service, they often keep requesting faster service or when they cannot have access to the internet through computers or mobile phones, they easily get anxious.   In conclusion, an increasing number of people seek instant gratification today. The information technology has nudged people to embrace the fast life. I contend that this technology has brought conveniences to our daily life based on the unprecedented speed and at the same time, it makes people addicted and impatient. Thus, the technology is advantageous and disadvantageous simultaneously.  ",8,True,82.125,365
"Some faraway places such as Sahara desert or the Antarctic have grown in popularity among tourists over the last decade. There are both advantages and disadvantages to both the tourists and the places hosting them. In this essay, I will elaborate on my view. It is undeniable that having more tourists enables these places to earn more revenue.  It gives rise to the tourism industry and thus generates revenue for the local government. With more revenue, the government can enhance the living standard of the local people by spending money on infrastructure such as roads. As for the tourists, they can broaden their horizon by visiting the challenging places such as Sahara desert. Tourists rarely left footprints on those places about a decade ago, leaving them full of mysteries and secrets. Travelling to the faraway lands will open the eyes of people who dare to travel. The exposure to extreme weathers, epic views and the like provide a travel experience unlike any other the traveler has ever had. However, if more tourists visit the previously unexplored places, it can cause serious pollution and damage to the natural habitat of many animals. Some tourists are unaware of the importance of protecting the environment. For instance, some tourists who travelled to Antarctic a few years ago left a huge amount of rubbish there, leading damages to the homes of hundreds of penguins. Furthermore, not everyone can afford to go to the Sahara desert or the Antarctic as they require certain level of physical and mental fitness. Tourists daring to visit / visiting those distant places should be ready to take physical and mental challenges. Otherwise they may suffer from dehydration as their bodies cannot tolerate the extremely boiling temperature of the Sahara desert or the freezing cold of Antarctica. To conclude, there are both advantages and disadvantages to traveling to some places that people rarely visit due to the positive benefits to the economy and the individual. However, one cannot ignore the negative sides, as this can be detrimental to the environment and it is a physically and mentally challenging task for the individual.   Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Energy is a powerful commodity that controls the functioning of the entire world. Solar energy obtained from the light rays of our Sun has seen a recent rise in its popularity, especially as a source of energy in many households across the globe. There is a possible explanation to this situation. Energy production from non-renewable sources like coal and petrol will be difficult / will be less viable in the near future not only because of the reduction in their reserve but also due to the high costs quoted by the countries which hold their reserves. Therefore the entire globe has become busy in developing renewable sources of energy. Since sunlight is available in abundance, solar energy has become a better alternative to other forms of energy. Solar energy has its pros and cons, but the pros outweigh its cons. An advantage of solar energy is that it can be harnessed without having to build expensive power plants. Families can install solar panels on their roofs and generate adequate amount of energy to run household appliances such as lights, fans, heaters, refrigerators and so on. It is very simple and just needs the Sun out there in the sky. It is also clean and does not pollute the land or the air. On the other hand, solar energy grids come with their own price which is unaffordable to the underdeveloped and developing countries around the Equator. These are the countries which benefit most from the solar energy owing to their geographical location. In the developed western world the situation is quite the opposite. These countries are cold and receive only a small amount of sunlight. Consequently, not much solar energy can be generated there. Despite these short comings, Germany has emerged as the world leader in solar energy production according to a recent report issued by WHO. Germans have well understood the proverb “Make hay while the Sun shines”. It is now time for the entire world to follow suit. To conclude, solar energy is gaining popularity because it is safe and clean. In the coming years as the technology develops and solar panels become more affordable, its popularity will only increase.",8,True,67.33067442182522,361
"Nowadays people spend less time on their leisure activities. This trend has a serious impact on personal and community life. There are several reasons for this phenomenon.  Needless to say, the leisure time plummeted in the recent decade and we are dominated by the digital world. Myriads of people are lured by the internet and its concomitant services. In other words, people used internet services in the olden days only for their professional life and for acquiring relevant information. Whereas, this generation spends most of their free time on social media with their gadgets and they are addicted to these services especially Facebook, Whatsapp, and Twitter. In addition to that,   humans dedicate most of their time to achieve their set career goals, so they have to work around the clock and they do not even get time to look after their family life and health.

"Sample essay Technology has significantly changed the way we live and work. For instance it has allowed many of us to have flexible work hours. When we can have our data available in a cloud, we can work pretty much from anywhere in the world. Some people believe that this flexibility improves the quality of our life and work. However, in my opinion, working from home has both benefits and drawbacks. One of the most important benefits of working from home is the ability to spend more time with our loved ones. Some people argue that this will boost the morale of employees and encourage them to give their best. Remote working also benefits parents of very young children. A lot of women quit their jobs to take care of their children. If companies allow them to work from their home, they can join the workforce again. Companies also benefit when employees work from their home. They can save money on office rentals and utility bills. On the flip side, remote working has its drawbacks too. Some people believe that having a nice workplace where people can work together as a team and communicate closely is more beneficial than working from outside. I have a personal example on how distance can interfere with work outcomes. My boss travels a lot and sometimes I have a hard time meeting him. Once he asked me to prepare a presentation for a meeting we were going to have. As I started to work on it, I found out that I had some questions and I couldn´t reach him to clarify my doubts. I finished my work and then weeks later, when he got back, I showed him my presentation and it was not what he wanted. As a result, I had to do it again, which was a waste of time.

"According to some people, parents make the best teachers for their children. I fully agree with this view because parents are the greatest influence on any child and the upbringing that they give will determine what the child will ultimately become in their life.  Parents are the first and foremost influence on any child. For many children, during the first few years of their life, parents are the only people in their life. They learn all important life skills from their father and mother. Parents not only teach their children to walk and talk, but also play a crucial role in shaping their character.  The seeds of character are sown during childhood and if children receive the right upbringing grounded on moral values, they will stay true to their conscience throughout their lives. By contrast, children raised by parents who lack moral values are more likely to become criminals when they grow up. That is because children learn a lot by observing and imitating. They observe each and every action of their parents and do exactly what their dad or mom does. So, for example, if children find that their parents are always honest in their dealings, they learn the importance of becoming honest. Such children will not become corrupt when they grow up. Likewise, parents who treat their servants or drivers with kindness and compassion are knowingly or unknowingly developing empathy in their children. Parents are also the ones who encourage children to study hard and achieve their goals. Unlike teachers, parents have a vested interest in their children’s lives. They want their children to do well in life and bring honour to the family. Because of this reason, they never give up on their children. By contrast, in most cases, the contribution of the teachers at school or college is limited to helping their students learn their subjects.   To conclude, learning is not limited to mastering the concepts of science or mathematics. True learning happens outside the classroom and here parents are the ones who impart all important life lessons. Hence, the argument that parents are the best teachers for their children makes perfect sense.   Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

"It is true that sending satellites for space research needs a huge investment of taxpayers’ money annually. While there are certainly some benefits like addressing the climate changes and finding a habitable place other than earth there are certain drawbacks to be taken in to account.  On the one hand, celestial research is associated with lots of benefits. To start with, one benefit of space exploration is that it provides an opportunity to find a habitable place outside of earth. To be more precise, planet earth is highly populated and there is a limitation of natural resources and this is pushing the international countries to fund more space exploration programmes to find an alternative place for humans. To illustrate this, the American space research organisation NASA has spent trillions of dollars in exploration of Mars through experiments and has found out evidence of water. Secondly, planet earth is faced with climatic changes like global warming. Space stations act as vital sources of information and help predict natural disasters. A good example of this is the space station by Russian team which orbits around the earth and gives a clear picture of the forthcoming natural events.  However space research has its own downsides which ought not to be neglected .One drawback of spending taxpayers’ money on space research is that other areas that need development are neglected. What I mean is that spending exorbitant amount of money on building space ships will deprive the public of basic amenities like healthcare, education and infrastructure. Another issue involved in space exploration is that it risks the life of astronauts who are part of it .For example, due to technical errors the Challenger and the Columbia space shuttles by NASA on their way to earth exploded causing the death of all the crew members.

Thus, aid was the cornerstone of one of the most important economies of the world. However, aid could have never have achieved its goal if it was not for an unalterable political will that had triggered the mentioned economic mutation. Therefore, Aid is useless without a strong leadership. In fact, Aid may cause leadership of developing countries to be lethargic and hesitant to initiate an economic growth.

While learning English improves a person’s chance of finding employment, in my opinion, it should not be at the expense of local languages.

This is primarily because it offers employment opportunities to everyone. Multinational companies prefer to hire those candidates who are fully proficient in English. These conglomerates setup their regional offices in the developing countries such as India and Sri Lanka to leverage the local talent. Thus, they prefer local people who are fully proficient in English. A candidate who speaks English has considerably higher chances of finding employment than someone who does not know English. It is apparent that learning English has become crucial for getting a job. At the same time protection of local languages is inevitable. They are unique and represent a culture. If these languages die out, many secrets of the culture would also become extinct. For instance, Ayurveda books written in Sanskrit language contain remedies for many deadly diseases. Once this language becomes extinct, cures for many life threatening ailments will also be lost. The regional languages can be protected by educating the people. People should be made aware of their importance. For example, the government of India could conduct an exhibition showcasing the importance of Sanskrit and how it could benefit not only the regional people but the entire population of the world. To conclude, while it is imperative to learn English due to its enormous benefits, protection of local languages is also crucial for saving cultural identities.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"There is no doubt that in the fast paced life responsibilities of a couple have increased. Some people think that the couples who work should be equally responsible for the domestic chores; whereas, others believe that the responsibility of husband and wife should vary. In my opinion, it is important for the working couples to equally share the duties of the household. There are many reasons why I agree with the people who are of the view that the household duties should be equally divided among the working couples. Firstly, sharing responsibility creates happiness and strong family ties as the burden of maintaining a healthy lifestyle is not the responsibility of only one person. Nowadays, expenses have increased due to the change in the lifestyle; thus, putting the whole responsibility on a single shoulder is totally unethical. Secondly, sharing duties leads to a stress free life for both the husband and the wife. For instance, working couples can enjoy a better lifestyle because of the double income. On the other hand, there are people who believe that domestic chores are the responsibility of a woman even if she works outside of the home. This opinion stems from the age old belief that men are not responsible for cooking, cleaning or raising children. It made perfect sense in the olden days when men were the only bread winners and women confined themselves to their home. In this day and age when both the husband and the wife work this mentality cannot be encouraged. In conclusion, it is crucial for the working couples to share household duties because it simply is not possible for a woman to have a full time job and still manage all household duties on her own. Therefore, sharing the household responsibilities is imperative if the couples want to enjoy a happy family life and financial freedom. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"There is no doubt that more and more youngsters are addicted to computer games. Therefore, a few people argue that this habit can affect their mental and personal health. I fully agree with the above statement and this essay will discuss a few concerns related to these games. Firstly, most games are violent in nature. For instance, in games like Grand Theft Auto or Call of Duty, there are many scenarios where players need to kill others violently. In addition, they have many other options which encourage everyone to perform brutal acts. This can change the behavior of young adults who may react violently over even petty issues within their home or even in college. Overall, if there is an increase in exposure to this type of electronic games they may become more aggressive. Secondly, they can also reduce the bonding of adolescents with their friends and families as most of the games are not only addictive but also time-consuming. For example, all these games will have many levels and it may take months to complete everything. As a result, they will be spending most of their leisure time in finishing it rather than spending quality time with parents and classmates. So, these games can play spoilsport for youngsters in relationships.  In summary, this essay discussed how electronic games can cause violent behavior in youngsters and how they are affecting relationships. My opinion is in sync with the statement and I feel that they have a negative impact on young people.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

Therefore, some people think that the education system is the only important factor to the development of a country and they may be right.Education is the foundation of  developed society.

"A trend has emerged in the last two decades with youngsters watching more TV than ever before. One of the main reasons behind this issue is the recent advancements in technology in gaming and film industries. This tendency has both pros and cons, and will be further discussed in this essay.The latest developments in video game consoles attracted both children and adults to spend extra time watching TV, compared to the past. With interactive gaming characters and high quality graphics, children are more likely to spend long hours playing games in front of the TV. A recent survey showed that TV addiction among young people, for example, has significantly increased from 5% to 80%, which was supposedly caused by the introduction of advanced gaming consoles. This increase is also partially due to films, drama series and cartoons being easily available on pirated websites and various gaming platforms.This trend has had more negative than positive effects on young citizens. More time spent watching TV adversely affects the mental and physical wellbeing of a child. For instance, the obesity ratio among young individuals in the past 10 years has risen dramatically; this has caused further health problems such as anxiety and depression. However, TV can also be used in a positive way. It is a great source of information that can help youngsters increase their knowledge and succeed in their future careers.In conclusion, recent breakthroughs in technology are driving up the amount of time our youngsters are spending in front of their TV screens. This can do more harm than good if we don’t regulate the use of TV, but parents have the power to make TV time useful and beneficial for their children.",8,True,90.88636363636364,279
"In the modern era, internet has become an essential part of everyday life. It is often said that people can learn about life and cultures of other countries by using the internet and hence there is no need to travel. I strongly disagree with this idea and in this essay I will provide some arguments to support my opinion. From an overall perspective, there is a wide variety of reasons why I believe that travelling is essential to know about cultures of other countries. The primary argument in favour of this idea is that it helps to clear our misconceptions about other cultures. In other words, the internet is producing biased information about some countries because of political agenda. Therefore, people need to interact with other cultures and try to know them personally. As a result, it clears our notions about other cultures. For example, the New York Times magazine website in 2015 portrayed Saudi Arabia as the most dangerous country for women, where they are only allowed to wear Burkha. This was proved wrong by the President Barack Obama when he visited Saudi. Another argument in support of travelling is that it helps people to enjoy by doing new things. If people are only acquiring information from the internet about the culture and life of different countries, then their life will become monotonous and uninteresting. In other words, people often enjoy getting practical experience of other cultures and life such as  the type of clothes they wear and food they have. For instance, it is a well known fact that the majority of foreigners who visit India enjoy wearing sarees and trying butter chicken. Hence, people enjoy doing new things rather than only acquiring knowledge about other cultures through internet.  In conclusion, this is a topic which is relevant to the modern society. I strongly believe that travelling to other countries to learn about other cultures and life is necessary. This is because it not only helps to clear notions about other cultures but also makes people’s life more adventurous. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"The internet is like an ocean of knowledge filled to the brim that anyone can easily access on their computer or mobile phone. This essay will discuss the benefits and the drawbacks of this trend. On the one hand, the internet offers in-depth information on any topic in a fraction of seconds. Firstly, it provides many web sites which have accumulated vast knowledge from many sources making it easier for educational purposes. If this option is not available then students will be forced to read / refer various books or speak to an expert to get answers to their questions. Secondly, the internet has made information gathering an enjoyable activity. For example, we can learn about geographical or historical information about our home or favorite places with the help of multimedia applications. Overall, we can get abundant knowledge through the internet. However, readily available information is not without its disadvantages. Some of the materials / content we access on the internet may not be genuine. For instance, a few may carry propaganda or fake information and direct the users to do harmful things. Studies have shown that many terror outfits misuse social media platforms to lure youngsters into becoming a part of them. This is indeed a dangerous aspect of the internet and users should be prepared to protect themselves from such threats.

"It is true that many museums and historical sites are visited by tourists, and not local people who live there. There are several reasons for this situation. In this essay, we will discuss the reasons for this situation and suggest a range or measures that we can take to fix this issue. One of the main reasons is that these museums and historical sites are always busy and also expensive to visit. For example, I live in Washington areas where there are several museums. These museums require reservation which need to be booked two or three months prior to the visit date. Also, these museums cost more than fifty dollars per person per visit. Another reason is the lack of awareness about these museums & historical places among local population. Local population in general may not know the prominence of these museums and sites while tourists who are coming from other places are in general curious about the places they are visiting. For example, one of my friends visited the place where I live and we started visiting the museums. To fix these problems, museums should reserve some of the entry tickets to local people which will make it more convenient for the locals. Another solution is to reduce the ticket price to locals. This reduction in price will make these visits attractive to local people who are price sensitive. Another solution is to promote these museums as attractive weekend destinations among long people. Governments should also allocate more funds to carefully maintain and preserve these structures and make more attractive and useful to local people. In conclusion, tourists have different interests than local people and museums concentrate more on tourists than local people. That being said the above mentioned solutions like price concessions and reserving some tickets to local people and creating awareness can encourage more local people to visit museums.

"The argument that whether experienced employees aged 55 or above should retire and give opportunities to the younger generation remains controversial. I believe that companies should encourage the former ones to stay and work for them as the experience and skills they possess cannot be matched by those of the new generation. It is obvious that if seasoned workers retire earlier, they can provide more opportunities to the new workers. However, the high level employees have superior skills and experience that new workers lack. As some workers have worked in the same company for more than two or three decades, they are familiar with the day-to-day operations of the company and their expertise is a valuable asset to the company. Their retirement will result in a great loss of a large pool of skilled and talented workers. Consequently, the company will suffer from an insurmountable loss. Others may argue that recruiting more youngsters can help companies save money as the salary of experienced workers is exceptionally high. The salary of an employer working at a managerial level may be thrice as much as that of an entry level employee. While this may be true, the retirement of experienced employees will lead to a talent crunch that affects the bottom line of the company. If high level workers retire there will not be enough experienced workers to provide training to the newly hired employees. Without the intensive guidance and supervision of their mentors, new employees will not be able to hone their skills. Gradually, the company will lose productivity and revenue. To conclude, while some may suggest that our older generation should retire at an earlier age to give more chances to the younger ones, I do not agree with the statement as their retirement means a tremendous loss to the companies.  ",5,True,64.73211210575653,300
"In recent years, a number of individuals prefer to start their own organization, rather than to be employed by a company. In this essay, I will discuss some of the causes of this phenomenon and examine the disadvantages of this development. There are many reasons why some people prefer to start their own business. The most significant reason is that they want full freedom to work. That is to say, they do not like to take orders from others, and want to work on their own terms. Furthermore, another crucial reason is that they believe they can earn more money by working for themselves. This is because they do not have to share their profit with others, and they can also control the company expenses. To illustrate, many Indians prefer to start their own company, so that they can get a sense of satisfaction, and also earn maximum reward. However, this trend has many negatives. A major drawback is that many businesses fail because people do not have the required skills and experience to run a company. In other words, a vast amount of expereince and multiple skills such as management and technical skills are required to run a company successsfully. If the owner does not have these skills, his company will incur heavy losses and would be forced to shut down. For example, according to a report by Times India, more than 70 percent of Indian start-up firms fail within a year due to the lack of expereince and bad management. In conclusion,  many individuals like to start their own business because they feel that they will get more independence and huge profit. However, such ventures can fail if the entrepreneur lacks the required skills and experience.",8,True,60.879721030042916,287
"Some people hold the opinion that advertising plays a vital role in convincing consumers to purchase products. However, others opine that advertising has lost its importance since many people have started ignoring it. I believe that advertising is still a primary way for many companies to sell their goods and this essay will elaborate on the same in the following paragraphs while discussing both the viewpoints. On the one hand, in the current times, industries are using a plethora of marketing techniques such as captivating packaging designs, coupons, hefty discounts and other attractive offers in order to attract customers and boost their sales. Moreover, some companies reach their target audience with the help of sophisticated technological advancements such as email newsletters and online promotions to increase their customer count. For example, according to a survey conducted by Times of India, there was a huge rise in online sales in the past 5 years with a considerable change in the advertising methods and strategies used to attract consumers. Hence, it is evident that although there are changes in the advertising approaches, they still have an indispensable role to play in persuading people. On the other hand, some individuals claim that they are less likely to pay heed to advertisements as they are omni present. Although it is possible to skip messages from some advertisers, it is impossible to resist the appealing offers that appear on the screens of mobile phones. To exemplify, many mobile users are reluctant to stop their urge to check the deals that are trending and thus they unintentionally click on the offer messages. To conclude, advertising is still a potential leader in grabbing the attention of buyers even though some people try to disregard it.",8,True,83.14521959268708,287
"Social websites such as Facebook and Twitter are increasingly becoming popular. According to some people, social media has adverse impacts on the individual and the society. In my opinion, such sites have caused distraction to many. However, they have also impacted us in a positive way as people can stay in touch with their social groups. On the one hand, many individuals are prone to get distracted due to overuse of social networking sites.  Because of this distraction they gradually tend to become addicted to such sites. As a result, they often do not prepare well for their academics and career and this will eventually affect their grades and performances. For example, a study conducted by Alpha Inc, revealed that there is a direct correlation between the performance of an individual and their usage of social networking sites. Thus, many people are adversely impacted by overuse of social media. On the other hand, these social networking sites have helped the community to stay connected despite the geographical boundaries. Given the fact that the internet has become very affordable, family members and friends are able to stay in touch on regular basis. Consequently, unlike in the past, most of the people in the society are strongly bonded. For instance, thanks to Facebook my father can now stay in touch with his college mates. Obviously, this development has brought a positive change to the society as a whole.  To conclude, in my opinion, although the social media has affected people’s performances and academics to a certain extent, on a larger perspective it has benefited the community as whole because such sites have enabled the society to network well.

"Nowadays people work around the clock; as a result, they become tired by the end of the day. Some people opine that taking rest and having a sound sleep is the best way to relax our body and mind. However, others believe that doing some workout and playing sports is a better way. I agree with the former view, and I will discuss both sides in the forthcoming paragraphs. To begin with, a power nap is a better way to relax our body. Firstly, sleeping helps our body to rejuvenate our body cells. When a person is sleeping his body goes into the self-repair mode, and takes energy from the consumed food. Consequently, people feel fresh when they wake up. Secondly, it is a well-known fact that the efficiency of a person increases when he takes naps to relax. For example, according to the World Health Organization, people who take regular sleep are more efficient and have better problem-solving skills than the people who work continuously. Thus, it is evident that power naps can enhance the capabilities of the individuals. On the other hand, doing physical exercise for relaxation can increase the blood flow in the body which helps in reducing daily work-life stress. As a result, people will feel relaxed and free from all the tensions. Therefore, some people believe that it is a better way to relax. Yet, this is not something people can or want to do when they are tired after working in the office for long hours.

"Some people feel unsafe when they are at home and in public. What are some possible causes of this and what are some possible solutions? In today’s world, people may feel that they are put in danger wherever they are. This essay will state what causes this phenomena and how to tackle it. Various factors can cause people feel insecure. Firstly, media somewhat encourage people to worry about their safety by informing about high crime rates. News programmes on TV tend to report sensational crimes to attract more audience.  If someone is constantly exposed to violent images of crimes such as terror in public places, the person would doubt the security more compared to someone who is not aware of the accidents. Secondly, natural disasters occur more and more frequently as a result of global warming, making people difficult to ensure their safety even at home. Clearly, we are experiencing more common extreme weather condition such as flooding and droughts across the globe.  Since we cannot avoid the damage of these natural disasters by staying inside, fear of dangerous weather conditions keeps growing among people. In order to tackle this problem, governments and individuals should work together. Governments can place more police on streets to deter criminals and protect citizens. By doing so, governments can reduce crime rates as well as people’s fear of offenses. At the same time, individuals should carefully select what to watch on media and understand the reasons for violent tendency of news. In addition, planning safety measures and precautions in the event of natural disaster can help allay concern of the public. One good example here is to build sea walls to prevent cities from being damaged by flooding. In conclusion, I suggest that governments and individuals tackle the feeling of insecurity among the public by reducing crime rates and prepare for unexpected natural events.

"How can this problem be solved ? Nowadays, overpopulation is increasingly becoming problematic. Cities around the world are becoming very crowded and this is a serious problem. This essay will discuss the reasons why this is happening and put forward some solutions for this issue. To begin with, there are two main causes of overcrowding in cities. Firstly, the concentration of public services such as hospitals and schools in cities. It is easier for people in cities to have access to such services than those in rural areas. For instance, approximately 90% of public services in Sudan are in cities. This clearly shows that people migrate to cities looking for these services. Another reason of overcrowding in cities is their vibrant and active lifestyle which attracts people from rural areas. Generally speaking, the easy access to public services and the fast pace of life in cities are the main reasons of overpopulation in cities. On the other hand, the overcrowding in urban areas around the world can be addressed in two ways. First of all, governments must provide public services to people in the countries. The sick people instead of travelling to cities looking for treatment will be able to have access to doctors in their counties. Furthermore, governments must build new cities to decrease the size of population in overcrowded cities and metropolitan areas. For example, the Japanese government has successfully reduced the size of population in its big and crowded cities by 20% by building new cities. This clearly prove the effectiveness of such a measure in reducing the number of people in overcrowded cities across the globe. To sum up, this essay discussed the reasons why cities are becoming overcrowded which in brief because of the concentration of public services in cities and the vibrancy of lifestyle in them. In addition, this essay offered two solutions for such a problem and these are providing public services in rural areas and constructing new urban cities.",7,True,50.01420644500213,324
"In some modern nations, more women are waiting until their late-thirties or forties to start having kids. As a result, the average age of first time mothers in increasing. This essay will explore the causes of this trend and explain why I believe it is a positive employment. Firstly, more and more women delay marriage to gain higher educational qualifications or to establish themselves in jobs and careers. Women of this generation are not bound to the traditional concept of marriage; instead, they seek and have the freedom to pursue their own gorals. It is challenging for a woman to have babies and take good care of them while she is busy with her studies or work. What’s more, in order to have an edge in some competitive workplaces, women have no choice but to put off their plans for having babies. Another reason why women and their partners decide to postpone having children is that advances in fertility technology allow them to make this decision. Thanks to technologies that allow the freezing of eggs, women can have babies even in their forties. This option has given women some flexibility in deciding the right time for them to have babies. The preference for a delayed first pregnancy is a good phenomenon because it represents a stronger family focus and better parenting. Older parents who have secure jobs and income tend to have more financial ability to provide for their children with great education resources. In addition, without the stress of earning money, older parents can spend more time with their children and accompany them with patience.  To conclude, the invention of fertility technology enables women to pursue their career goals and postpone the typical timeline for having kids. It is a beneficial trend because older parents can provide a better upbringing to their children.    Need help with English grammar?

"Many a time applicants are asked to provide personal information including their interests, hobbies and also marital status. Some recruiters feel that this information is useful. I agree with that view. In my opinion, personal information gives a lot of insight into a job applicant’s personality and hence it is crucial; however, there is a small risk of it being misused by the employer. However, whether an employee needs to share personal information depends on the nature of the job. For example, a recruiter does not have to ask for the personal information of a contract employee or a consultant whose service is required for only a short period. Whereas in the case of a permanent job an employer must know about an applicant’s hobbies or interests as knowing about a person’s interests can help to understand if they possess leadership skills or if they are a team player. An employer may also benefit from knowing a potential employee’s marital status. For example, if an employer is looking to hire an air hostess who is supposed to work odd hours and even on weekends, it does not make sense for them to hire a woman with young kids. On the down side, some people insist that employers should not ask for personal information. According to them, the recruiter may use the personal information to discriminate against an employee and this argument is valid to a certain extent. For example, an employer may decide not to hire an applicant whose religious or political ideologies clash with theirs. To sum it up, I believe that the personal information is useful for the employer because in most cases it is a very important indicator of a person’s personality and his comfort level with a job. It is, therefore, understandable why employers ask for this. However, there is a small risk that the employer could use this information against an employee.",8,True,72.27087650227932,317
"Many people have contrasting views on the way they enjoy their favorite sport. Some prefer to stay home watching the event on televisions while others like to feel the excitement of watching an event live. In my opinion, watching your favorite sport on television is more convenient and economical than watching it in the stadium. On the one hand, people feel excited when they watch a live sporting event. For instance, watching other supporters in the stadium cheering their teams makes the experience all the more exciting. It makes people feel as if they themselves were playing the game. One cannot feel such excitement while watching the event on television at home. Moreover, people always get a chance to see their superheroes in action in the stadium.  On the other hand, there are certain drawbacks as well to watching a live sport event. Firstly, it is not economical as one needs to travel to a particular destination and spend on tickets to watch a live game. This is something that can be avoided by watching your favorite sport on television. Secondly, in the stadium where there is rush, people always struggle to watch close movements of the player, whereas on television you can watch a number of action replays.  In conclusion, although you can enjoy super excitement and live atmosphere by watching a match in the stadium, you can avoid the rush and reduce expenses by watching it on television. I prefer the latter. ",8,True,59.28651685393258,244
"People have different opinions about whether secondary school students should learn different subjects in general or focus only on a few core subjects. In my opinion, it is more beneficial for them to learn a variety of subjects at this age.  If students have access to a wide diversity of subjects in middle school and high school, they can become quite knowledgeable. Our society is advancing at such an unprecedented pace that many professions that prevail today are forecast to vanish in the near future. That poses a multitude of challenges to the younger generation who will survive only if they are equipped with a wealth of knowledge in a variety of domains. Consequently, learning multiple principles from science to languages helps them gain substantial amounts of information, concepts and genres, facilitating the acquisition of knowledge in various areas. Thus, those who learn a range of subjects in secondary school can be more capable and competitive once they enter the highly competitive workplace.  Another measured benefit of learning more subjects during adolescence is that children can hone various skills. Different courses require distinctive capacities of students, so the students who can survive and perform well in a diverse curriculum are more likely to become a well-rounded learner. For example, in math class children can improve their numerical and reasoning ability whereas what they acquire in history class is how to perceive and judge the historical events by analyzing the underlying reasons and making meaningful assumptions. This training of different types plays an integral part in stretching middle-school children in different areas. By attending these classes, they can enhance their competency in a wide sense which allows them to qualify for different types of jobs in the future.  In conclusion, given that children in secondary school can benefit from learning a broad curriculum, I firmly advocate that educational institutions provide general education to young people.

"It is true that languages play an important role in life. Some people argue that governments should invest money for preserving languages to avoid the loss of culture. However, I believe that spending money on saving endangered languages is unnecessary as governments should pay more attention to public services such as health care. There is the commonly held view that governments should spend money on preventing languages from extinction so that a wide range of cultures can be protected / preserved. This is because each language usually represents one culture. For example, there are eleven types of indigenous languages in Taiwan and their mythology and ancient literature are written only in those respective languages. If these languages die out, part of their cultures will permanently vanish. However, it is widely known that the loss of minority languages does not significantly impact people’s lives as only a few people use them.  My strongly held belief is that governments should not waste money on saving endangered languages. It is evident that these languages are less valuable and less beneficial to people’s lives. Many studies show that saving a language will certainly cost a large amount of money and only a few people particularly linguistics can benefit from it and it increases the financial burden on a nation. By contrast, if governments can allocate more funds to the development of medical devices, they can certainly save many lives. Therefore, the government should focus on improving crucial sectors instead of wasting a lot of money to save local languages. In conclusion, while it is true that saving local languages is crucial for conserving cultures associated with them, in my opinion, it is more important for the government to invest in essential services like healthcare and education. Hence, I am not in favour of spending a lot of money for saving languages. Do you have an essay on this topic? Submit it below in the comments for a free band score estimate.

In my opinion, using modern technologies and enforcing strict pollution control laws are crucial for improving the situation. One of the causes of water pollution is the discharging of sewage water into the rivers and oceans without any treatment. The sewage water contains harmful bacteria which can bring serious threat to the aquatic life. In an effort to prevent these issues, modern technologies like sewage water treatment plant can be used to treat sewage water for recycling and reuse the treated water for domestic purpose. This will not only reduce sewage disposal issues but also solve the problem of water shortage. For example, developed countries like USA have an impeccable system which not only treats sewage water for disposal purpose, but also recycles in such a way that they can use it for normal domestic purpose. In other words, modern technologies ought to be used for reducing water pollution. Besides water, air has also some grave issues. One of the main causes of air pollution is a huge amount of debris generated from construction sites. Air pollution has affected not only flora and fauna, but also humans. In order to eradicate air pollution, the government must implement stringent environmental policies for construction sites. For example, in order to get an interim commencement certificate the developer must seek approval from the environmental department, which regulates the air pollution level for construction sites. This will ensure that construction sites do not generate harmful waste and preventive actions are taken to alleviate air pollution. In short, stringent policies which regulate pollution levels at sites can help to reduce air pollution. To conclude, advanced technologies and stern policies are necessary to prevent further deterioration of air and water quality.

"Worldwide people are following latest fashion and are grooming themselves accordingly. I believe easy availability of merchandise and advertising have made these revolutionary changes. It is definitely a positive trend both for the individual and the society. To commence with, globalization and digital technology have made the way for international businesses to flourish across various nations. Top brands, trendy clothes and style which were limited to a particular country are now easily available in many countries.  People can buy them online or from stores. Moreover, advertisements have greatly influenced people to follow fashion trends. Many celebrities are made brand ambassadors and they start advertising for the products on television, newspapers and on social media. Thus, people become aware of what is trending in the market and certainly it creates an impulse in them to buy it. Perhaps, they don’t want to get bullied for doing something which is not in fashion, so they go along with the trend. In my opinion, this is definitely beneficial for an individual because it helps in enhancing one’s personality. People who are up to date are always looked upon by their colleagues and friends, and are appreciated. This boosts their self confidence and body image. To illustrate this, studies have shown that people who are stylish and trendy are more happy and cheerful. Furthermore, due to increasing demand, there has been a tremendous growth in the business, which ultimately has increased the rate of employment. People are employed in various sections like production, marketing, packaging, sales and so on. Therefore, public is being hired for the same and this has reduced the percentage of unemployed population significantly which is good for the country’s development. In conclusion, as new fashion is accessible to people due to globalisation they can follow it with ease. It creates employment to a large extent and also aides in boosting one’s personality and confidence, so it is indeed a positive development.

"It is gradually becoming a trend among youngsters in nations across the world to be uninterested in reading newspapers or staying tuned to the news on the TV. This essay discusses the causes of this development and measures that can be taken to curb it. The youth generally consider / regard perusal of newspapers to be boring, because they feel it is for the elderly. This has brought about the general consensus that youngsters do not have keen interest in the news because, they want to remain ‘’Hip”. They also find articles in the newspaper to be less of their concern as they feel they should rather use their time to keep up with their friends and have fun without bothering about the happenings in the world at large. For instance, youngsters would rather read about their Reality TV crush coming to an event nearby than the floods ravaging another state. Another cause of this lack of interest is that most stories on newspapers and television are related to business and politics and juveniles do not have much interest in them. To curtail this trend in the society, it is up to the caregivers of these young adults to instill in them the culture of listening to or reading the news. To Illustrate, parents can make reading news a morning routine in their household. They can also offer a reward to their children who have read the most articles in a week and prepared a summary of them. This will get their offspring more enthusiastic about perusing news prints as there is a compensation attached. In conclusion, the rise in the number of young adults showing lack of interest in reading news articles or watching the news on the TV can be attributed to the misconception that news is for the older generation. To solve the challenge parents need to instill / inculcate the culture of watching or reading news in their offspring.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Since ancient times, schools have been considered as the temple of knowledge. Therefore, it is often believed by the majority of the population that the education system is the backbone of a nation’s progress. I completely agree with this statement. This essay will discuss how education benefits a nation and its people.  Undoubtedly, education plays a significant role in students’ career and ensuring a better life for them. Having more qualified professionals reduces the unemployment rate of a country. In other words, employed candidates contribute their academic knowledge and expertise skills to their working field. This offers benefits to the organization and consequently a better national economy. For example, a recent study by Cambridge University revealed that nowadays developed countries are contributing more funds to the education system considering it as an important factor of progression. Furthermore, education not only enhances the local economy but also leads to a better society. This is because when people are educated, they have improved chances of finding better jobs and earning a higher income. Rich people pay more taxes and thus benefit the nation. In addition, activities such as crimes, corruption, and other illegal actions will decline. This is due to consciousness about the rules and regulations of law. This is due to awareness of the laws and regulations. For instance, a recent survey conducted in metro cities of India found that crime and poverty rates have decreased. In conclusion, the education system is always considered as an imperative factor for the development of a nation as it develops a nation’s economy and the living standards of the people.",8,True,68.17731526510869,266
"Online shopping has become exceedingly popular over the years. For many people, the internet has become a one stop shop where they can buy everything from books to travel tickets. In my opinion, this method of buying has both advantages and disadvantages and it is hard to say whether advantages outweigh disadvantages. On the bright side, online shopping is extremely convenient. Most people these days have hectic schedules and as such they get hardly any time to buy things in store. Online shopping is a boon for them. It eliminates the need to physically visit the stores to place the order. You can buy whatever you need by simply tapping a few buttons on the screen. This facility saves both time and money. Also, most online stores offer huge discounts on their products. They have comparatively low overhead costs and this enables them to sell their products at lower prices than regular brick and mortar stores. There are also many platforms where buyers can compare prices in different stores before hitting the Buy button. Most online stores also have a review section where people can post their opinion about the products they bought. These reviews allow potential customers to know beforehand what they can expect if they buy a particular product. On the other hand, online shopping does have many limitations. To start with, reviews can be fake and you cannot buy a product on the basis of reviews alone. Another downside is that you cannot touch or feel the product before you buy it. You have to make the purchase decision based on the picture shown on the screen. This can be problematic when you buy clothes because without actually feeling the fabric it is hard to ascertain its quality. Online shopping is not suitable for last minute purchases because it may take days or weeks before the shipment arrives. Now in case you are not happy with the product, you have to return it and wait many more days for the replacement to arrive.   In conclusion, the main advantage of online shopping is the convenience. However, it does have many downsides which cannot be overlooked. Hence, in my opinion, it is hard to say whether advantages of online shopping outweigh the disadvantages.

"All children who are in high school should be trained in money management. This essay agrees with the argument that teaching youngsters about money is essential as it is a crucial skill for success in their future life. During teenage, all expenses of a student are met by their parents and hence they do not gain any experience in money management. Shortly after their teenage, these little ones will have to face real life where effective spending of money becomes a significant aspect of living. So, if proper training is provided for handling money at an early age, it can be beneficial for their future as well. For instance, a recent study conducted by the University of Delhi found that students who did not attend money management courses at school level were struggling to manage their income in future as well. After the school years, most of the students start earning by themselves. Contrary to the stage where they had to depend on elders for all needs, they reach a period where they have income of their own. If young people lack financial skills / knowledge of how to use their income efficiently, they will spend all of their money without saving any. So, if proper guidance on expense handling is included in school curriculum, this situation can be avoided. For example, the Times recently reported that most of the students who received training in income and savings paid on their own for their graduation. To conclude, all teenagers should be provided money management lessons in school. This can help them in future and will also aid them in handling their income effectively.

"Some people are of the opinion that in order to know about other nations, it is necessary to travel. However, I believe that people can learn about other nations by watching television and using the internet. On the one hand, some people argue that travelling is the best way to learn more about other nations. They think that without travelling it is not possible to learn much about the cultures, traditions and even languages of other nations. For instance, in their opinion, travelling allows us to interact with local people and know what they like and dislike. In addition, they believe that travelling is a great way to practise a language with its native speakers. This will significantly improve the ability to speak other languages. So, in these people’s opinion, the best way to learn about other nations is to travel. On the other hand, there are people who insist that we can get all the information we need about other countries online and on television. I strongly agree with them. There are many websites that contain everything about every country on this planet. Information about foods, cultures, traditions, languages and weather can be found on websites such as Wikipedia and YouTube. It is also possible to meet different people from other countries online and befriend them. For example, I personally have friends from different countries around the world whom I have met online.

"There is a drastic increase in the number of people who watch movies and listen to music online because of free access to this content. Personally, I believe this is a negative development which can lead to time wastage, inefficient use of human energy and potentially insignificant utilization of the internet data. The biggest downside to the easy access of movies online is that it makes people unproductive. When they should be doing something productive that would help themselves and their country, they are wasting their precious time watching nonsensical movies online. They know that these useless videos will not help them in any way, yet they watch them for hours on end because they provide entertainment. Unfortunately, this unproductive activity certainly reduces the amount of time they get to study or work. Watching online videos for a long time can also be detrimental to health. In other words, sitting idle doing nothing but clicking the mouse button can hurt the fitness level of a person. This is particularly bad for the youth who needs to utilize their boundless energy for something productive/healthy. For example, they could volunteer for a charity or hit the gym when they get free time. Another issue associated with watching too many online movies is that this practice leads to the wastage of useful bandwidth. The internet data is a valuable resource. Using it merely for entertainment is a wasteful venture especially since it can be used in much more productive ways.  That is to say, this data can be utilized to enhance knowledge and skill by watching knowledgeable videos. In conclusion, although it has become more popular for people to entertain themselves through the internet, it has brought about too many problems for this to be considered a positive trend.",9,True,98.66666666666667,296
"Here is a sample response. Most of us now spend a great deal of our time at the workplace. If we love our work, we will get to spend much of our lives doing things that we enjoy doing. Because of this reason job satisfaction plays an important role in ensuring our wellbeing. In fact, people who are satisfied with their jobs are healthier and happier. Job satisfaction means different things to different people. For some, it means earning a six figure salary or occupying a higher level position in an organization. A lot of people equate wealth and social status with happiness and wellness. They don’t mind spending their entire lives at the workplace provided that they receive handsome salaries. Some people may have well-paying jobs but they are still unhappy because they don’t like what they are doing. There are also people who find satisfaction in helping others. Money does not motivate them. They are driven by their passion to change the world. Most of them will readily work for an NGO or some other charity. While it is true that everyone seeks job satisfaction, few people actually manage to find it. The rest are simply spending their time at the workplace with the sole objective of earning a livelihood. They don’t like their job, but they can’t quite it either because they need money to support their family. The vast majority of workers, unfortunately, belong to this category. This dissatisfaction with their work and the lack of motivation to do it eventually lead to various health problems in these people. Several studies have shown that work related stress is a major cause of health problems in adults. To conclude, everyone seeks job satisfaction, but very few people manage to find it.

"Reducing the crime rate is crucial to ensuring the safety and security of people living in a particular society. While some people are in favour of building more prisons and increasing the number of policemen, others feel that achieving economic welfare is the key to tackling crime. In my opinion, all of these measures are required to fight crime effectively. There are several benefits to increasing the number of policemen patrolling the streets. They will act as a deterrent and force offenders to think twice before engaging in robbery or shoplifting. They will also increase the sense of safety among law-abiding citizens. It is equally important to punish those engaging in criminal activities. They are a threat to the life and property of people and hence they should be kept in confinement. The hardships that they face in the prison and the subsequent social alienation may reform at least some of them. Perhaps a better solution to reduce the crime rates is to ensure financial security for everyone. Studies have shown that most criminals have poor financial backgrounds. In most cases, it is their poverty that compels them to commit criminal deeds. If the government can create more jobs and provide economic security for all the people, the crime rates will automatically drop. Of course, this will require the government to invest more in education and vocational training. Educated and trained people will be able to create jobs themselves. They are also less likely to get into crime. To conclude, tackling crime is a tough task and the government has to employ all possible means to achieve this. This will involve deploying more policemen on the streets, putting criminals behind the bars and ensuring economic security for all the people.",9,True,62.44438341115078,290
"Owing to the advancements in the internet, most of the e-commerce sites these days provide a facility for the users to share their feedback about the products they have purchased. Although this can sometimes misguide the consumers, in my perspective, it is beneficial as it helps the buyers to check the credibility of the product. Admittedly, the facility of the online reviewing system is misused by many producers. The reason for this is that in order to increase the sale the sale of their products they often buy fake positive reviews because/as customers prefer to buy products with higher ratings and more positive reviews. To exemplify, the start-up mobile company ‘Juno’ fooled thousands of people throughout India with the help of misleading and false reviews of their non-smart and low-quality mobile phones. Nevertheless, despite the aforementioned drawback, the sharing of opinions on the goods purchased online is advantageous as it can provide a better insight into the product quality. With this platform people who have already bought the item can openly share their good or bad experience of using that product. Consequently, this will not only help the other buyers to analyse the effectiveness of the item, but also make the selection of items easy for them. For instance, in the global ranking of the facilities that the e-commerce sites provide for the end-users, Amazon’s rating facility on each product is ranked first, as it facilitates the users to buy the best item. In conclusion, while there are some instances where an unauthorized feedback system can be misleading, in my opinion, the overall review system is a benefit for the end-users as it allows them to analyse the quality of goods.

"According to some people, watching movies is a waste of time. I strongly disagree with this opinion as movies can be very informative.  Movies are considered as one of the most popular forms of entertainment and relaxation suitable for all age groups of society. To begin with, movies can be educational and inspirational rather than just a waste of time. Apart from entertainment, there are many movies that are based on current social and environmental issues, extraordinary achievement of individuals and major historic events. Such movies motivate ordinary people and have a huge impact on the society as well. For example, the movie, Three Idiots, challenged the traditional form of education system stressed upon the idea of learning by doing instead of just cramming the books. As a result, many public schools made changes in their school curriculum to provide education in an innovative and creative way. Therefore, watching movies helps individuals to learn important lessons from them along with entertainment. Another reason why watching movies is not a waste of time is that movies are the best form of entertainment and relaxation. At the present moment, most of the people are living a stressful and hectic life. Watching movies facilitates to relieve this stress to some extent and helps people to think or work with a relaxed mind. Furthermore, it provides people a great opportunity to spend quality time with their loved ones. Schools and colleges organize special trips to cinemas from time to time for their students to provide them a break from their busy study schedules.

"Nowadays, traffic jam is a major challenge faced by almost all the big towns and cities. An increase in the volume of private vehicles and insufficient utilization of public transport facilities are the causes of this problem. One of the prime reasons of traffic congestion in big towns is the soaring number of automobiles on roads. This is a problem as the count of vehicles increases on the road it leads to long queues and halts. For instance, in 2014 one of the biggest traffic congestion was reported in china’s capital city Hong Kong which lasted for more than 24 hours.

As a result, there would be a straight drop in the number of automobiles on roads by 50%. Another major cause of traffic congestion in large cities is the inefficient use of government transportation system. This is because trains and buses are not always reliable and also frequent services are not available in many areas. This can be resolved if authorities can ensure a comfortable and reliable ride and subsidise public transport.

"It is believed that the primitive advancements in technology are comparatively more beneficial than the ones in the modern era. However, I am not convinced of perception and strongly opine that latest inventions are more advantageous to general public. The first merit of contemporary technological developments is their easy affordability. Due to mass production policies, the cost of various commodities dropped considerably. Owing to this, people can easily afford these at competitive prices. Mobile phone is a primary example as it is now accessible / affordable to almost every individual which was not possible earlier. Secondly, convenience is another positive aspect of modern technology. With the help of research and development centres, the bulky parts of machines have been replaced with lighter yet stronger material. As a result, it is easier to carry them from one place to another. Modern computers, for example, are sleek and speedy in comparison to earlier room sized scientific computers. Thirdly, the modern technology is more eco-friendly and durable than its older versions. Subtle modifications and up-gradations make the products more environment friendly by reducing their emissions. To exemplify, latest steel manufacturing units set up by Tata group produces approximately seventy percent less carbon dioxide than the earlier machines. In this way environment can be protected from the harmful emissions produced by the use of technology.

"Sample essay The wealth of a nation is its people. Even in this twenty-first century millions of people living in poor nations do not have access to health care facilities or education. Since their governments lack the financial means to improve their living standards, some people feel that the rich nations should help them by providing financial aid. I agree with this argument. In my opinion when rich nations help poor nations, it is a win-win situation for both. Rich nations have excess funds. By giving financial aid to poor nations, they can improve the living standards in the third-world. Poverty is the root cause of many social evils. It is a well-known fact that poor countries are the breeding grounds of several anti-social elements. The poor, in general, are unhappy with their own lives. They are also angry with the rich. Needless to say, many of them have criminal tendencies. It is not possible to reform them without improving their living standards. By providing financial assistance to poor nations, the rich countries can alleviate poverty in those nations and make the world a more peaceful place to live in. Giving financial assistance to poor nations makes excellent business sense too. When poor nations develop, the purchasing power of their people will increase. This provides a great opportunity for rich nations that are also the hub of manufacturing. By helping the poor grow, they can increase their wealth too. To conclude, when rich nations give financial assistance to poor nations, they are not only being generous but also helping their own industries and people. Irrespective of our gender, nationality or religion, everyone deserves access to good food, health and education. Therefore, in my opinion, nations that have excess funds should use them for the betterment of poor nations. After all, we all belong to the family of humanity. ",9,True,81.82248871610713,308

By contrast, in the past, people with good moral values were always respected. Some people believe that celebrities are known for their beauty and money instead of their hard work and it causes a bad impact on our younger generation. In my opinion, this is true to a great extent. Nowadays, money and glamour means everything to most people. They consider them to be the key to success. This is the reason why celebrities have millions of followers on their social networking accounts. People, especially our younger generation, try their best to copy the lifestyle of their favourite celebrities. Whatever celebrities wear and do become the new fashion statement. Big brands make huge profits by hiring celebrities to endorse their products. More people are willing to buy a product if it is endorsed by a celebrity. This popularity enables celebrities to earn a lot of money and people start to believe that stardom is all about money, name and comfort. Unfortunately, young people do not see or understand the hard work that celebrities put in to become what they are. They only see their luxurious lifestyle and get deluded. Every day they also find ordinary people become instant celebrities thanks to online platforms like Youtube and Instagram. Young people often fall into the traps of depression when they cannot achieve similar fame in spite of working hard. They also fail to understand that instant stardom does not last long.

"The last few years have experienced burgeoning growth in the number of animal species facing the threat of extinction.  In my opinion, this happens mainly due to hunting and changing environmental conditions. Some measures can be taken to prevent the situation from getting worse. Firstly, man hunts animals not only for food but also for aesthetic products. Owing to the fact that some animals have commercial value, hunters exploit them. For instance, tiger skin is used widely for making mattresses and blankets, and this leads to indiscriminate killing and the extinction of this species, because people show interest in buying exquisite products. Although every animal is not for food, some cuisines include wild endangered ones. Secondly, due to human intervention in the previously unexploited areas, climate has changed which makes it difficult for some species to survive in their natural habitat. For example, Penguins are in the endangered list as global warming poses threats to their survival. One way to protect endangered animals is to rehabilitate them in artificial environment such as zoo. Some animals may have special dietary and environmental needs which are only possible if they are treated separately.  Another possible solution is to establish breeding program so that there can be an improvement in the number of younger ones. Also, if strict action is taken against those who violate the law and poach wild life, then the extinction due to human intervention can be avoided. To conclude, a variety of factors such as human intervention, excessive poaching and change in climate cause the extinction of wildlife. By enacting stringent ant-poaching laws we can improve the situation to a great extent. It is also important to protect endangered species in zoos and dedicated wildlife sanctuaries.

"Tourism has become an indispensable source of income for many countries and communities. Some people claim that some areas are susceptible to culture loss and therefore, they should be closed entirely to tourists; however others insist that this measure is not beneficial to the locals. In this essay, I will discuss both views and then give my opinion. On the one hand, supporters of banning tourism often argue that religious, linguistic and socio-cultural behavior will likely be more affected by the influx of tourists. Tourists often interact with the local people in different ways, and the locals may adopt certain foreign practices and customs. This may be bad for traditional local culture. For example, children in touristy areas may prefer to speak foreign languages rather than native languages because they want to communicate with the tourists. Some people, therefore, feel that closing such areas to tourists is the easiest way to conserve local culture and traditions. On the flip side, banning tourism can have an adverse effect on local economy. Also some cultural changes may inevitably happen whether we allow tourists or not. There are many local communities that survive on tourism. If tourists stop coming, local businesses will retire and unemployment rate will increase. The negative economic consequences of banning tourism are worse than any cultural loss that may occur from the arrival of tourists. In my opinion, if we want to preserve our values and traditions it is not necessary to close tourist places, because the consequences of doing that will be profoundly devastating. Local authorities and individuals should work together to promote local culture and raise campaigns. This can be done by using many forms of communication like television, internet or radio.  ",7,True,102.65212892339804,285
"It is insisted that only legal sanctions can promote the rate of recycling in homes, which has failed to reach the appropriate level. In my opinion, this may help; however, more measures are required to encourage recycling.  Legal regulations can be an efficient solution to promote recycling. They can have an instant impact on people’s participation in recycling. When the government makes recycling a legal requirement, the public will consciously and deliberately engage in recycling as part of their duties and will be cautious about their behaviours. To illustrate, when the related legislation comes into effect, people, who used to put the garbage out without bothering to recycle it, would abide by the rules to avoid fines and blames. Thus, more garbage can be collected and turned into products through recycling. Along with legal sanctions, the government has to increase the public’s awareness of the correlation between their behaviour and the environmental degradation. It can have a long-term influence on the public’s awareness and behaviour. Even if legal regulations come into effect, the monetary fines could be of a small amount and many people will continue to throw garbage out. Therefore, people’s awareness should be enhanced for them to voluntarily join recycling for a long term.  In conclusion, legal regulations have been suggested to encourage people to get involved in recycling more actively. I contend that legal measures can bring forth instant improvement in recycling and, at the same time, more campaigns should be arranged to influence people’s participation in recycling for an extended period.

Taking initiatives and helping the group in various tasks and becoming a role model for them is possible only through repetitive practice. It is rare for a newbie to be successful in the first few attempts. For instance, Mahatma Gandhi was a remarkable leader and from his autobiography we can see that it was through his life experiences and practice that he learned the skills required to be a good leader. Therefore, I believe that leadership is not an inborn skill but an acquired one. Along with leadership quality some other factors are also considered while selecting a good manager. These are good communication skills, empathetic nature and good manners. Firstly, good communication is extremely important for a leader as he needs to communicate effectively within his group as well as to the customers. In addition, empathy is an equally important characteristic for a manager because only then his subordinates or customers will feel free to express their feelings to him. Finally, the ability to maintain one’s cool even during tough times makes one an ideal choice for a manager.   For instance, managers may have to deal with tough clients and during such situations it is necessary for them to be calm and good mannered to cope with the situation and resolve it. Therefore, apart from leadership quality, all the other characteristics mentioned above are extremely important for a good manager. In conclusion, leadership is not an inherent skill but an acquired or learned one. Managers who possess leadership quality, communication skills, empathy and good manners will do utmost justice to their roles.  Do you have an essay on this topic?

"It is true that parents need some knowledge and experience in order to raise their  in an appropriate way. In this regard, many families attend different training courses. While I agree that these courses might be useful for some of them, I totally disagree with the recommended obligatory  of such training.On the one hand, training courses usually offered by governments could be very useful for those guardians who have a  with special needs. For example, if a child has a birth defect or has been diagnosed with any mental or musculoskeletal disorders, these kinds of training could be lifesaving. Additionally, as we know, the first few months after birth are really a crucial period of a child’s life; parents should obtain different information related to their child’s vaccinations, common health problems, different developmental issues and so on, which can be delivered through such training courses.On the other hand, I believe that making these programs  a mandatory option would cause several problems for societies and individuals as well. To begin with, in order to achieve this goal, many professionals should be trained which may not be affordable for some governments. From an individual’s point of view, this kind of  programs could be very time-consuming for some families who have other  at home or who work long hours. The other important consideration is that parent training courses may not provide all the necessary information for each and every family. To be more specific, parents could get more beneficial information through different websites such as YouTube according to their own preferences.In conclusion, although I believe that many families can take advantage  training courses, I do believe that making them  a compulsory option for everyone is too time and money-consuming for individuals and governments.",8,True,112.25105331388755,290
"It is argued that the popularity of cinemas will reduce dramatically in the coming years because it is a lot more comfortable to watch a film on television or computer than purchasing a ticket to go to cinema. This essay disagrees with the argument that cinemas will become less popular.  Watching movies on a large screen provides better clarity of pictures and a higher level of entertainment and because of these reasons the audience, especially youngsters, will prefer to watch films in cinema theatres. Young adults enjoy going to the cinema because it is a fun and relaxing activity for them.  According to a recent article published in Times of India, a survey was conducted among young people interested in watching films. It was found that about 65 % of the younger generation chose to see movies in theatres along with their friends on weekends in order have a break from the usual routine. So, going to cinema is not only for watching movies but also for having some leisure time with friends and family. Watching movies on a large screen is a more satisfying experience than watching it on a TV or a laptop because the large screen offers more clarity.  While it is comfortable to watch films at home, people choose theaters with precise audio- visual effects because they cannot afford to have such a broad range of accuracy on their small screens. For example, nowadays there has been a rise in 3D and 4D films which can be watched only on specialized devices. Furthermore, watching movies on a big screen often makes people more delighted and satisfied.  To conclude, the popularity of cinema theatres will not diminish as young people enjoy watching movies in the theatre because they provide total entertainment and also because the large screen offers precise sound and visual effects.

"There is no doubt that diabetes is one of the common diseases found among middle aged people across the world. In order to control this, governments are taking preventive actions by introducing / through the introduction of additional taxes on food and beverages with high sugar level. Although many people believe that this an excellent step by the Government, others argue that this might not be really helpful. In this essay, I will discuss both the views and lend my support for the former one.  A large number of people believe that increasing the taxes on food and beverages will only fill government’s coffers with additional money. Additionally, paying the extra tax would increase the burden on middle class people and might even deprive them of sugary products. Furthermore, this would adversely impact the manufacturers of these products and they might have to bear heavy losses due to falling demand.   On the other hand, this step by government would discourage people from buying food and beverages with high sugar content. This is not only beneficial for adults but also for children, who are tempted by a lot of sugary items such as soft drinks and chocolates. These are the major causes of obesity and hypertension in young children. According to a recent report, increased taxes on Pepsi and Coke have decreased their sale by 30 percent as compared to the last year. Therefore, this could be helpful in controlling the increasing number of diabetic patients. In other words, this measure will do wonders for public health and help both the government and the people to reduce their spending on medical treatment.   In conclusion, though it might look like a rigid step taken by the regulating bodies, I believe, it can turn out to be extremely helpful for everyone, and will make them healthier and fitter.

"It is undeniable that a lot of people try to hide their real age and attempt to look younger. In fact many people dislike the question about their age and find it embarrassing. Personally, I think this is because aging has been associated with many diseases and illnesses, whereas looking young always reflects beauty and good health. However, this obsession with looking young has many negative effects on individuals and societies.  To begin with, the need to defeat aging is not a new trend as people throughout the history were always fascinated by the strength and the charm of young people. For example, many ancient civilizations claimed that they had found the secret of eternal youth. This phenomenon has never changed in the modern age. Inspired by the media and celebrities who always ensure that they never get old people are now more concerned about their age and ready to do anything to keep their young looks. Thus youngsters’ need to look good is related to the influence of popular culture and media. Unfortunately, this is not a positive thing for several reasons. Firstly, many individuals are being obsessed with their age to such an extent that they splurge on cosmetics products and surgeries. This in turn has devastating impacts on their general health. For instance, studies have shown a strong link between breast cancer and breast enlargement surgery. Secondly, many people, who try to look younger, act like youngsters as well, with all its recklessness and issues ignoring the wisdom that is supposed to come with aging. Therefore, the attempt to defy aging is harmful to both individuals and communities.  To conclude, the obsession with looking young is fuelled by many factors including peer pressure and media influence. Unfortunately, this is a negative trend and hence it should be discouraged. People need to realize that there is no harm in getting old and rather than trying to look young, they should learn to appreciate the wisdom and maturity that come with aging.

"One of the most conspicuous trends of today’s world is a colossal surge in the number of  vehicle accidents  cars, trucks and buses, all over the , be it in impoverished or developed nations. There is a wide range of factors that . In my opinion, this situation could be remedied, provided some effective measures are taken.Measures to deal with this soaring concern are many; the most significant  are not remote or complicated but accessible and practicable. The primary one lies in the fact that governments should take a firm stance and apply stringent rules and regulations to lower the speed limit. Secondly, using  electronic devices while driving should be forbidden by law. Finally, an awareness program could be initiated by individuals to educate the public about the catastrophic effects of unsafe roads and the projected enhancements for road safety. Only when convergent efforts from all sectors are ensured, can we expect to see considerable progress in tackling this problem.There is a deluge of merits for implementation of reduced speed limits. High speed is likely to impose life threatening danger on people crossing the roads, due to the perilous nature of this hazardous speed with danger being an integral part of it. Not only does reducing the speed limits contribute to decreasing daily accidents, but it also raises the standard of driving. Needless to say, all these advantages have a far-reaching impact on pedestrian safety.There are, however, some pitfalls that can easily overpower the potential benefits of limiting speed. The primary one stems from the fact that slowing the speed could lead to augmenting the daily traffic hours. Besides, it could also delay delivering sick and  patients to hospitals. Hence, it is apparent why some individuals are against changing the standardized level of speed.From what has been discussed, one can conclude that despite the drawbacks of reducing speed limits, the expected benefits of this measure are indeed far greater.",8,True,100.04609929078015,317
"It is accepted by the whole world that a murder is the most heinous crime that can be committed by a person. Hence there are laws made in every part of the world to punish the murderer. While some people argue that a person who has committed a murder should be awarded the death penalty, others insist that the law cannot commit a murder and hence punishing the murderer with a life imprisonment is a better idea. I agree with this statement to a great extent. In my opinion, if the criminal is willing to reform himself, it is better to award life term instead of the capital punishment. Many people believe that the death penalty is the best form of punishment for a murder since it keeps a check on the crime. Many people fear the punishment and are scared to commit these kinds of crimes due to the penalties involved. The death penalty is also useful to send a message to the rest of the world that no matter who you are if you commit a murder you are going to be executed for your actions. This fear is helpful to reduce the homicide in many countries.  On the other hand, there are people who believe that if a murderer is killed then the total number of murderers in the world remains the same. Therefore in order to penalize them, life imprisonment seems to be a better option. Firstly, the mental state of the criminal should be assessed before awarding any punishment. If the person is mentally unstable, a second chance should be given to him to rectify the crime that he has committed. Secondly, many people also believe that the execution of the murderer will not bring the victim back to life. So it is not a perfect compensation for the victim’s relatives.  In conclusion, people need to accept responsibility for their actions. Punishing murderers with death penalty is one way that the society can help people to realise the consequences of their actions. However, if the criminal repents his action life imprisonment may help him to reform himself and this in turn will benefit the whole society. Do you have an essay on this topic?

"Band 7 IELTS essay sample The growing menace of pollution and traffic congestion on our motorways may be due to an increase in the number of vehicles. Some people believe that by increasing the price of fuel this menace can be tackled. In my opinion, this is a wrong assumption and does not address the core issue of pollution and traffic control. In my opinion, petrol being the lifeline of our economy is an essential commodity. By increasing the price of this commodity, we can only hurt the growth of our economy. If fuel prices increase, everything from essential medicines to vegetables will become expensive. More importantly, many people may take advantage of this hike in petrol price to make a quick gain. Because of these reasons, I totally disagree with this measure.  Some other measures should be explored to combat this menace. The most important way of doing this is to promote the use of public transport in place of private and personal vehicles. To encourage people to use public transport, busy roads should be made accessible to only public transport during peak hours. This measure will force commuters to use public transport such as buses and trains.  But the authorities have the responsibility to build an efficient and reliable public transport network in place. This has been done in countries like Singapore with a high rate of success. Another measure also adopted in countries like Singapore is to increase the price of cars and other personal vehicles. This also encourages the use of public transport system in place of private cars. Some other measures too should be taken. For example, the motorways should be maintained properly, the use of railways should be encouraged and old and polluting cars should be removed from our roads.   It is my belief that increasing fuel price solves no problem; rather it creates another set of problem. By exploring alternative ways of combating this issue, we may attain greater success.

"These days a vast majority of people want to lead an independent life. The fundamental reason lies in people’s educational qualifications that fuel their craving for freedom in life. This can be seen as a positive trend because living alone is likely to nurture a mature mindset at early stages of one’s life.Many people are well educated to stand up on their own. Tertiary education broadens their horizons, and they wish to experience freedom of life. With a very good educational background it becomes easier to find a well-paid job, and with lucrative income they gain confidence to lead an independent life, thereby achieving their goals. For example, engineering graduates can find a job in another town and their salary is enough for them to move and settle down there. This enables them to move away from their family and live on their own.Living alone helps one to develop maturity, which can be seen as a positive impact on individuals and the society as a whole. Being independent means young people have to face life challenges alone and going through this process improves their resilience. They become more responsible, as they have to take care of themselves and develop budgeting skills and saving habits, for their future needs as well. Better planning of their finances nurtures the custom of wise spending at early stages of adult life.In conclusion, the reason why many people wish to live independently these days is because their education level gives them both the awareness of freedom in life and means of achieving it. Since living alone promotes one’s maturity, it seems to be a positive trend in today’s society.",8,True,97.27350053792361,274
"Mass media plays a crucial role in our everyday life, and it is widely used to stay in touch with our near and dear ones and also to communicate messages with our peer groups. In my opinion, mass media does have some demerits, but those are negligible compared to the advantages it brings to our lives.  To begin with, through radio, television and internet programs people can gain knowledge and information on almost every topic. For example, they can find health information, learn about environmental issues and stay updated on science and technology through mass media programmes. The radio, for example, is a major source of information for people living in remote areas. It enables them to stay abreast of the latest developments in the world.  If there were no radio, perhaps it would take them weeks or even months to receive national and international news. Television and the internet provide not only entertainment but also knowledge. For example, both children and adults can learn a lot about science, technology, history and wildlife through television channels such as Discovery and National Geographic. Obviously, mass media benefits our lives in numerous ways.  On the flip side, it does have some negative aspects. To start with, mass media can be quite addictive and it is not uncommon for people to spend inordinate amounts of time in front of their television or computer. Unfortunately, this practice hurts their health. It may also affect their social skills because couch potatoes are less likely to go out and interact with others. Another downside is that some content on the television and the internet is not appropriate for children. For example, if children get exposed to violent or obscene visual content, it can affect their behaviour. In conclusion, the benefits offered by mass media certainly outweigh its downsides. Even so, it is important for users to limit the time spent on electronic devices to limit their exposure to harmful content and to ensure that they stay healthy and socially active.

"In some countries teaching English at schools is becoming more important than teaching the local language. This may lead to the demise of some languages.  Putting English at a higher level of importance at schools than the mother language is a very bad idea. Firstly in this essay I will discuss when English should be taught at schools and then the need for using English on a daily basis in countries where English is not the mother language.  English should be studied when someone realizes that  it’ll be necessary for his or her career. Many people know no English until they are grown up, but they can study it and achieve a great level of proficiency after sometime. For example, in 2005 only 30% of the population between 30-40 years old in Brazil knew how to speak English well, but 10 years later, 65% of the population between 40-50 years old were very good English users.  Not everyone needs to know English to go through the day. many don’t use it during their routine. By this it’s clear that a local language is far more important, because that’s the one used in that specific place. Keeping it like this can save this particular language. A study done by USP about country cities in 2016 showed that only 10% of these city’s citizens need English regularly.              To conclude, thinking that English is more important than a local language is a risk that’s not worth taking. Learning English when you are older and out of school is a great way of keeping other languages alive. Letting people who don’t use English every day speak only their own natural language is more important than teaching English to them. ",7,True,64.37171258609894,277
"People everywhere are now under tremendous stress. In my opinion, there are many factors responsible for this. Luckily, there are also some ways to alleviate stress.  One of the major factors that cause stress on people is the work pressure. This is because employees are inundated with numerous corporate responsibilities that do not take into consideration their personal lives. Few businesses care for the wellbeing of their employees. They only want to multiply their profits. As a result, employees are often forced to put in too much effort. The obligation to perform the tasks efficiently within a limited time frame puts them under tremendous pressure. For example, as per a survey conducted by psychologists in India in 2019, 70% of the stress cases were due to excessive work pressure. To lessen this issue, I believe that work duties should be assigned considering the human capabilities, so that one one feels relaxed rather than anxious while performing those duties. Another factor / the other factor that might be held responsible for stress is the unhealthy / growing competition among the individuals. The reason for this is that, nowadays, people are trying to compete with each other in every aspect so as to achieve the superiority. For instance, people working at managerial level in Multi National Companies compete with their colleagues so as to attain promotion. Thus, the pressure to outperform their colleagues can elevate their stress levels. To tackle this issue, it is essential for the government to step in. The government should enact labour laws that prevent employers from exploiting their employees. It is also essential to spread awareness among people about the importance of keeping stress levels low. People should be encouraged to opt out of the rat race to live a contented and stress free life.  In conclusion, heavy load of work and soaring competition are the factors that put people under stress. However, it is essential to conquer this menace because stress can affect the health and productivity of people. The government can achieve this to a great extent by enacting humane labour laws.
